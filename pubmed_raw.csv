Despite intensive conservative therapy, end-stage arthropathy requires surgical treatment, either by ankle fusion (AF) or total ankle replacement (TAR).
Eleven consecutive AFs were performed in nine patients and 11 TARs were implemented in 10 patients. Outcomes were assessed clinically by AOFAS score and radiologically by the Pettersson and Gilbert scores.
The mean age of the patients in these groups were 35.7 years and 49.4 years, respectively. Of the 11 ankles that underwent fusion, 10 showed bony consolidation not later than 12 weeks after surgery, whereas one still showed non-union after 6 months. VAS pain scores decreased significantly in both groups. Mean AOFAS scores also improved significantly, from 28.1 before to 80.3 after AF and from 21.5 before to 68.0 after ankle replacement. No perioperative complications were observed in either group. Late deep infection was observed in two patients that underwent TAR, which required removal of the implant.
Our data indicate that both AF and TAR result in significantly reduced pain in patients with haemophilia with end-stage haemophilic arthropathy. While TAR is associated with a higher risk of deep infection and minimal persistent pain, it preserves the pre-operative range of motion. AF on the other hand is associated with the risk of non-union and a longer post-operative recovery period but results in greater pain reduction."|Our data indicate that both AF and TAR result in significantly reduced pain in patients with haemophilia with end-stage haemophilic arthropathy.

Secondary aim was to identify predictors associated with increased cost-effectiveness of PTAR.
Pre-operative and six-month post-operative data was obtained over a 90-month period across the two centres receiving adult referrals in the UK. The EuroQol general health questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) measured health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ) measured joint function. Predictors, tested for significance with QALYs gained, were pre-operative scores and demographic data including age, gender, BMI and socioeconomic status. A cost per QALY of less than £20,000 was defined as cost effective.
The 51-patient cohort [mean age 67.70 (SD 8.91), 58.8% male] had 47.7% classed as obese or higher. Cost per QALY gained was £1669, rising to £4466 when annual (3.5%) reduction in health gains and revision rates and discounting were included. Lower pre-operative EQ-5D-3L index correlated significantly with increased QALYs gained (p < 0.01), all other predictors were not significantly (p > 0.05) associated with QALYs gained.

Further knowledge regarding individual axis of motion of the ankle is therefore needed.
Therefore, digital twins, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technology were used to identify a real personalized motion axis of the tibiotalar joint. Three-dimensional (3D) models of distal extremities were generated using computed tomography data of normal patients. Digital twins were used to reproduce the mobility of the ankles, and the real ankle of the patients was matched to the digital twin with machine learning technology.
The results showed that a personalized axis can be obtained for each patient. When the origin of the axis is the centre of mass of the talus, this axis can be represented in a geodesic system. The mean value of the axis is a line passing in first approximation through the centre of the sphere (with a variation of 3 mm from the centre of the mass of the talus) and through a point with the coordinates 91.6° west and 7.4° north (range 84° to 98° west; - 2° to 12° north). This study improves the understanding of the axis of the ankle, as well as its relationship to the possibility to use the geodesic system for robotic in ankle arthroplasty.
The consideration of a personalized axis of the ankle might be helpful for better understanding of ankle surgery and particularly total ankle arthroplasty."|The consideration of a personalized axis of the ankle might be helpful for better understanding of ankle surgery and particularly total ankle arthroplasty.||The results showed that a personalized axis can be obtained for each patient.

The quality of the included studies was evaluated according to Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS).
Nine articles were ultimately included in the systematic review. The implant position and function outcome of TAA was similar between PSI and SI. Prediction accuracy of implant size remained great difference. PSI can shorten the operative time and fluoroscopy time.

5|34315246|Evaluating and Managing the Painful Total Ankle Replacement.|['ankle arthritis', 'complications', 'cysts', 'lucency', 'osteolysis', 'subsidence', 'total ankle arthroplasty', 'total ankle replacement']|Foot & ankle international|The number of total ankle replacements (TARs) performed in the United States has dramatically increased in the past 2 decades due to improvements in implant design and surgical technique. Yet as the prevalence of TAR increases, so does the likelihood of encountering complications and the need for further surgery. Patients with new-onset or persistent pain after TAR should be approached systematically to identify the cause: infection, fracture, loosening/subsidence, cysts/osteolysis, impingement, and nerve injury. The alignment of the foot and ankle must also be reassessed, as malalignment or adjacent joint pathology can contribute to pain and failure of the implant. Novel advanced imaging techniques, including single-photon emission computed tomography and metal-subtraction magnetic resonance imaging, are useful and accurate in identifying pathology. After the foot and ankle have been evaluated, surgeons can also consider contributing factors such as pathology outside the foot/ankle (eg, in the knee or the spine). Treatment of the painful TAR is dependent on etiology and may include debridement, bone grafting, open reduction and internal fixation, realignment of the foot, revision of the implants, arthrodesis, nerve repair/reconstruction/transplantation surgery, or, in rare cases, below-knee amputation.|||||10.1177/10711007211027273|2021-07-29|[{'lastname': 'Henry', 'firstname': 'Jensen K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rider', 'firstname': 'Carson', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cody', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ellis', 'firstname': 'Scott J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Demetracopoulos', 'firstname': 'Constantine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.'}]

Short endurance limits the former, and movement disability comes with the latter. It is hypothesized here that fusion of the STJ can improve the longevity of the TAR prosthesis. In this study, a fresh human cadaver's ankle joint underwent TAR surgery, and strain patterns in the vicinity of prosthesis were recorded after the application of axial compressive load on tibia, resembling stance phase of the gait. Then, STJ of the same sample fused (FTAR), and a similar test procedure was pursued. The obtained strains in the FTAR were smaller than those of the TAR (p < .01). Finite element models of the tested samples were also made, and validated by experimental strains. The validated FE models were then employed to find stress distribution on the tibial plateau and prosthesis compartments. FTAR demonstrated more regular stress profiles in bone-prosthesis interface. Also, maximum von Mises stress in the talar component of the FTAR is approximately half of that in the TAR (8 and 15 MPa, respectively). Based on the results of this study, having a more symmetric load distribution on the prosthesis after STJ fusion, longevity of the TAR may likely increase.||||© 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|10.1002/cnm.3514|2021-07-28|[{'lastname': 'Taghizadeh', 'firstname': 'Yousef', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Chitsazan', 'firstname': 'Ahmad', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Pezeshki', 'firstname': 'Saeid', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Taghizadeh', 'firstname': 'Hadi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Tissue Mechanics Laboratory, Biomedical Engineering Department, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Rouhi', 'firstname': 'Gholamreza', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.'}]

Twenty-five consecutive patients among 141 TAR were treated with our outpatient protocol relying on three fundamentals: bleed control, pain control, and autonomy. They received 1 g of tranexamic acid before surgery, and after discard from post-operative care unit, they were operated under long-lasting nerve block precociously relayed by oral NSAIDs and had an immediate full weight-bearing authorization at discharge.
No patients we readmitted for an acute care following TAR, especially for haematoma or uncontrolled pain. Mean VAS was < 1 before discharge from post-operative care unit and < 2 until day 90. One patient had a delayed wound healing treated surgically at day 30 without implant revision.

We report our early experience, complications, and radiological and functional outcomes.
Patients were recruited from 11 specialist centres between June 2016 and November 2019. Demographic, radiological, and functional outcome data (Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale, Manchester Oxford Questionnaire, and EuroQol five-dimension five-level score) were collected preoperatively, at six months, one year, and two years. The Canadian Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (COFAS) grading system was used to stratify deformity. Early and late complications and reoperations were recorded as adverse events. Radiographs were assessed for lucencies, cysts, and/or subsidence.
In all, 500 patients reached six-month follow-up, 420 reached one-year follow-up, and 188 reached two-year follow-up. The mean age was 67.8 years (23.9 to 88.5). A total of 38 patients (7.5%) presented with inflammatory arthritis. A total of 101 (20.0%) of implantations used patient-specific instrumentation; 167 patients (33.1%) underwent an additional procedure at the time of surgery. A total of seven patients died of unrelated causes, two withdrew, and one was lost to follow-up. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months (6 to 36). There was a significant improvement from baseline across all functional outcome scores at six months, one, and two years. There was no significant difference in outcomes with the use of patient-specific instrumentation, type of arthritis, or COFAS type. Five (1.0%) implants were revised. The overall complication rate was 8.8%. The non-revision reoperation rate was 1.4%. The 30-day readmission rate was 1.2% and the one-year mortality 0.74%.

The implant survivorship, patient reported outcomes, rate of periprosthetic cyst formation and reoperation rates are variably reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the functional outcomes and survivorship of the Hintegra TAR, in consecutive cases by multiple surgeons in a single UK institution, with a minimum of five year follow-up.
A retrospective review of prospectively collected data for 70 consecutive Hintegra TAR cases performed between 2010 and 2014. Data collected included patient demographics, complications, reoperations, revisions and patient reported outcome measures (PROMS: AOS, MOX-FQ, pain VAS and EQ-5D 3L).
Seventy patients underwent Hintegra TAR (54 male/16 female) with an average age of 69 (range 48-84 years). Mean follow up was 76 months (range 60-104), 10 patients died during the follow-up. Implant survivorship was 81.7% at most recent follow-up. The commonest radiographic finding was periprosthetic cysts (n = 28, 40%): size range (7-40 mm). Nine patients required re-operation: six periprosthetic cyst debridement and grafting at a mean of 61 months (range 27-91), one lateral gutter debridement, one periprosthetic fracture and one debridement for deep infection. PROMS data was available for the majority of patients. Mean final follow-up scores were total AOS 35 (range: 0-97), MOX-FQ 36 (range: 2-93), pain VAS 34.6 (range: 0-100) and EQ-5D 3L Index 0.69 (range: 0.08-1.00).

Data from national joint registries have shown between-country differences in the utilization of ankle replacement. The reasons for these differences are, however, not well understood. Our aims were to describe and compare the annual incidence of primary ankle replacement between countries and, to examine potential reasons for variation over time.
We used aggregate data and summary statistics on ankle replacements for the period 1993 to 2019 from national joint replacement registries in Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. From the annual recorded counts of procedures, demographic data were extracted on age, sex distribution, and indication(s) for primary ankle replacement. Registry-level summary results were also obtained on data completeness, counts of hospitals/units, and health care providers performing ankle replacements annually and data collection processes (mandatory vs voluntary). Annual ankle replacement incidence for all diagnoses and, by indication categories (osteoarthritis [OA] and rheumatoid arthritis [RA]), were calculated per 100 000 residential population aged ≥18 years.
For the period with data from all 6 countries (2010-2015), New Zealand had the largest annual incidence (mean ± SD) of 3.3 ± 0.2 ankle replacement procedures per 100 000 population whereas Finland had the lowest incidence (0.92 replacements). There were no common temporal trends in the utilization of ankle replacements. Over the years studied, OA was the predominant diagnosis in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, whereas RA was the most common indication in Scandinavia.
In these 6 countries, we found marked differences in the utilization of ankle replacements. Registry-related factors including data completeness and the number of hospitals/surgeons performing ankle replacements are likely to contribute to the observed between-country differences and need to be carefully considered when interpreting comparisons for this less common site for joint replacement surgery.

In total, 224 patients treated for end-stage ankle arthritis were enrolled in an observational trial. Of 112 patients followed more than 2 years, 48 patients (19 arthrodesis, 29 arthroplasty) had coronal plane deformity and were compared to 64 patients without coronal plane deformity (18 arthrodesis, 46 arthroplasty) defined as greater than 10 degrees of varus or valgus. The arthroplasty implants used had different internal constraints to intracomponent coronal plane tilting. Patients completed Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (MFA) and SF-36 preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively. Measures included change in SF-36 and MFA, as well as compared reoperation rates and pain scales.
For the groups with coronal plane ankle deformity, the median for the arthrodesis group was 19.0 degrees and the median for the arthroplasty group was 16.9 degrees. In the deformity cohort during the follow-up period, we had 7 major reoperations: 2 in the arthrodesis group and 5 in the arthroplasty group, all with the less constrained implant design. MFA, vitality, and social function of the SF-36 improved for all groups. Patients without preoperative deformities had greater improvement with fusion or replacement at both 2 and 3 years. There was no difference in improvement between those patients with coronal deformity who received arthroplasty vs arthrodesis.
Patients with and without coronal plane deformity may benefit from ankle arthroplasty and arthrodesis, although greater improvements may be expected in those without preoperative deformity. In this study, at final follow-up of 3 years, overall we found no meaningful difference in patient-reported outcomes between the patients with preoperative coronal plane deformities whether they had a fusion or a replacement as treatment for end-stage ankle arthritis.

Etiology of cavus foot type and varus ankle must be evaluated and confirmed. Pes cavus is increased height of the arch with metatarsus adductus and increased calcaneal inclination angle. There often is intrinsic musculature irregularity leading to imbalance of the foot. Although not all cavus foot types and varus ankle deformities are sequelae of neuromuscular disorder, neurologic etiology must be considered.

16|33983146|Comparing 4-Year Changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Ankle Arthroplasty and Arthrodesis.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"The rate of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is increasing relative to ankle arthrodesis (AA) for patients seeking surgical treatment for end-stage ankle arthritis. Patients and providers would benefit from a more complete understanding of the rate of improvement, the average length of time to achieve maximal function and minimal pain, and whether there is a greater decline in function or an increase in pain over time following TAA compared with AA. The objectives of this study were to compare treatment changes in overall physical and mental function and ankle-specific function, as well as pain intensity at 48 months after TAA or AA in order to determine if the improvements are sustained.
This was a multisite prospective cohort study that included 517 participants (414 TAA and 103 AA) who presented for surgical treatment. Participants were compared 48 months after surgery using the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) Activities of Daily Living and Sports subscales (0 to 100 points), the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS) scores (0 to 100 points), and pain scores (0 to 10 points).
Both groups achieved significant improvement in the 2 FAAM measures, the SF-36 PCS score, and all of the pain measures at 48 months after surgey (p < 0.001).

Comparative studies elucidate differences in treatment outcomes; however, the literature lacks evidence demonstrating what outcomes are important to patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate patients' experiences of living with both a TAR and ankle fusion.
This research study used qualitative description. Individuals were selected from a cohort of patients with TAR and/or ankle fusion (n = 1254). Eligible patients were English speaking with a TAR and contralateral ankle fusion, and a minimum of 1 year since their most recent ankle reconstruction. Surgeries were performed by a single experienced surgeon, and semistructured interviews were conducted by a single researcher in a private hospital setting or by telephone. Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) scores, radiographs, and ancillary surgical procedures were collected to characterize patients. Themes were derived through qualitative data analysis.
Ten adults (8 men, 2 women), ages 59 to 90 years, were included. Average AOS pain and disability scores were similar for both surgeries for most patients. Participants discussed perceptions of each reconstructed ankle. Ankle fusions were considered stable and strong, but also stiff and compromising balance. TARs were considered flexible and more like a ""normal ankle,"" though patients expressed concerns about their TAR ""turning"" on uneven ground. Individuals applied this knowledge to facilitate movement, particularly during a first step and transitioning between positions. They described the need for careful foot placement and attention to the environment to avoid potential challenges.
This study provides insight into the experiences of individuals living with a TAR and ankle fusion. In this unusual but limited group of patients, we found that each ankle reconstruction was generally perceived to have different characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Most participants articulated a preference for their TAR. These findings can help clinicians better counsel patients on expectations after TAR and ankle fusion, and improve patient-reported outcome measures by better capturing meaningful outcomes for patients.

Between December 2004 and December 2009, 80 patients (82 ankles) underwent a primary BOX TAA performed by a single senior surgeon, expert in foot and ankle surgery. Pain and functional outcomes were analysed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system, Foot Functional Index Disability and Pain (FFI-Disability, FFI-Pain) score for comparative analysis.
A total of 52 patients (54 implants) in a cohort of 80 (82 implants) were examined at a minimum ten years follow-up. Twenty implants out of 54 underwent implant failure (37 %) and 34 patients were enrolled in the present study. The mean VAS for pain decreased significantly from 8.5 ± 1.2 to 2.9 ± 2.2 (p<0.01) and the mean AFOAS score changed from 28.6 ± 11.8 pre-operatively to 72.7 ± 16.9 (p<0.01) at last follow-up. Ninety-seven percent was satisfied with a mean FFI-Disability score that improved from 77.6 ± 19.3 to 26.7 ± 25.4 (p<0.01) and FFI-Pain score that decreased from 76.2 ± 14.2 to 31.4 ± 25.6 (p<0.01). We calculated post-operative alignment using alpha, beta and gamma angles with no difference at long-term follow-up. The survival rate of the implant was 66% at ten years of follow-up.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate ankle plantarflexion strength before and after total ankle arthroplasty, and examine the interplay of pain, motion, and strength.
This prospective case-control study included 19 patients with end-stage ankle arthritis who received a total ankle arthroplasty and 19 healthy control participants matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Pain was measured with a numeric pain rating scale. Passive sagittal plane ankle range of motion (°) and isokinetic ankle plantarflexion torque (Nm/kg) at 60 and 120°/s were measured with an instrumented dynamometer. t-tests or non-parametric tests were used to evaluate outcomes across time and between groups. Bivariate correlations were performed to evaluate the interplay of postoperative pain, motion, and torque.
Patient pain and motion improved between the preoperative and six-month postoperative time points (d ≥ 0.7). Ankle plantarflexion torque was not different across time (d ≤ 0.5), but was lower than control group values postoperatively (d ≥ 1.4). Significant correlations between pain and motion (r = -0.48), but not torque (-0.11 ≤ r ≤ 0.13), were observed.
Unchanged following surgery, impairments in muscle performance following total ankle arthroplasty do not appear to be changed by improved pain or motion. These findings provide impetus for postoperative strengthening interventions."||||Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Between December 2010 and May 2016, 118 consecutive Zenith prostheses were implanted in 114 patients. Demographic, clinical, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) data were collected. The endpoint of the study was failure of the implant requiring revision of one or all of the components. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the rate of failure calculated for each year.
Eight patients (ten ankles) died during follow-up, but none required revision. Of the surviving 106 patients (108 ankles: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), n = 15; osteoarthritis (OA), n = 93), 38 were women and 68 were men, with a mean age of 68.2 years (48 to 86) at the time of surgery. Mean follow-up was 5.1 years (2.1 to 9.0). A total of ten implants failed (8.5%), thus requiring revision. The implant survival at seven years, using revision as an endpoint, was 88.2% (95% CI 100% to 72.9%). There was a mean improvement in Manchester-Oxford Foot and Ankle Questionnaire (MOXFQ) from 85.0 to 32.8 and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from 7.0 to 3.2, and overall satisfaction was 89%. The three commonest complications were malleolar fracture (14.4%, n = 17), wound healing (13.6%, n = 16), and superficial infection (12.7%, n = 15). The commonest reason for revision was aseptic loosening. No patients in our study were revised for deep infection.
Our results show that Zenith survival rates are comparable with those in the literature for other implants and in the National Joint Registry (NJR). Overall patient satisfaction was high as were functional outcomes. However, the data highlight potential complications associated with this surgery. The authors believe that these figures support ankle arthroplasty as an option in the treatment of ankle arthritis.

However, the literature on this procedure remains heterogeneous with large variability in outcome reporting methods. PRISMA guidelines were used to systematically review outcome reporting measures used in prospective studies and randomized control trials on total ankle arthroplasty published in 15 high-impact journals between Jan 1, 2009-May 1, 2020. A total of 43 studies were included and outcome measures were grouped into seven categories: pain, subjective function, patient satisfaction, complications, objective function, implant survivorship, and imaging. The most common topic of study was implant design followed by differences in outcomes when comparing total ankle arthroplasty and arthrodesis. The most commonly reported outcome measure was post-surgical complications. No study reported on all seven categories, while 22 (51.2%) studies reported on four or more. Subjective measures had significant variability with fifteen different Patient Reported Outcome Measures used across the studies. While the included studies were quite comprehensive, there was little consistency in reporting outcomes after total ankle arthroplasty. With improving outcomes and techniques in total ankle arthroplasty, and thus an expected increase in utilization and number of published studies, efforts should be made to use commonly employed outcome reporting methods to facilitate comparison of results across studies.||||Copyright © 2021 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Our results confirm that in well-selected cases a conversion to a total ankle replacement is not only possible, but also significantly improves quality of life and reduces pain. The outcome of a total ankle replacement after an ankle fusion depends to a degree on the method of fusion. Less destructive fusion that is arthroscopic has better results than conventional transfibular open fusions. Absence of a fibula should be an absolute contraindication for a conversion.||||Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This study seeks to determine if TAA with PSI yields different radiographic outcomes vs standard instrumentation (SI).
Sixty-seven primary TAA patients having surgery using PSI or SI between 2013 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed using weightbearing radiographs at 6-12 weeks postsurgery. Radiographic parameters analyzed were the medial distal tibia angle (MDTA), talar-tilt angle (TTA), anatomic sagittal distal tibia angle (aSDTA), lateral talar station (LTS), and talar component inclination angle (TCI). A comparison of the 2 groups for each radiologic parameter's distribution was performed using a nonparametric median test and Fisher exact test. Furthermore, TAAs with all radiographic measurements within acceptable limits were classified as ""perfectly aligned."" The rate of ""perfectly aligned"" TAAs between groups was compared using a Fisher exact test with a significance of .05.
Of the 67 TAAs, 51 were done with PSI and 16 with SI. There were no differences between groups in MDTA (

We evaluated integrated bone SPECT/CT in recurrent pain after TAR by validating a standardized reporting scheme, identifying uptake patterns, and assessing diagnostic performance and impact on clinical management.
A total of 24 TARs in 16 patients with persistent or recurrent pain received integrated bone SPECT/CT using diagnostic CT settings. Images were retrospectively reviewed, and a novel localization scheme was validated by assessing interrater agreement. Distinct uptake patterns were identified, and diagnostic test characteristics were estimated. Reference standard consisted of clinical follow-up, laboratory findings, and subsequent procedures, including revision surgery.
Standardized scoring of bone SPECT/CT uptake was highly reproducible (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.82). The final diagnoses were gutter impingement (n = 12), periprosthetic (stress) fracture (n = 5), loosening (n = 5), tarsal arthritis (n = 1), and erysipelas (n = 1). Overall, the diagnostic test characteristics of bone SPECT/CT were as follows: sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 82%-100%), specificity of 80% (95% CI, 28%-99%), and accuracy of 96% (95% CI, 79%-100%). Gutter impingement, periprosthetic fracture, and loosening were correctly identified in all cases revealing distinct uptake patterns. Importantly, persistent diffuse uptake was frequently observed, warranting cautious interpretation. Bone SPECT/CT impacted clinical management in 86%, with symptomatic improvement in 83% of patients.

PSI represents the most recent innovations introduced on the market of ankle arthroplasty:PSI is proposed as a surgical technique capable of making ankle arthroplasty more accurate and more reproducible compared to standard referencing guides Aim of the study is to report early clinical and radiographic outcomes obtained from a single surgeon experience by implanting the same ankle prosthesis using a standard (STD) or a PSI instrumentation Unlike no difference in the average increment of normalized sub score related to function in each group (PSI vs STD), the analysis of normalized pain sub score pointed out a greater average improvement in the PSI group(+75%)compared to the STD group(+62%);this result has been adovacated to the absence of post operative gutter impingement syndrome in the PSI group compared to the STD referencing group. The analysis of radiographic angles revealed a more accurate and reproducible positioning of the components in the PSI group; ankle arthroplasty performed with PSI reported a reduction of both surgical times and the need of intraop.fluoroscopy. PSI ankle arthroplasty achived more accurate and reproducible clinical and radiographic results compared to STD instrumentation;long-term follow-up are needed to demonstrate whether a better positioning of the implant is associated with an increased survival of the prosthesis and therefore justifies the additional costs of PSI.|||||10.23750/abm.v91i14-S.10989|2021-02-10|[{'lastname': 'Giardini', 'firstname': 'Piero', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Array. piero.giard@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Di Benedetto', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy. paolo.dibenedetto@asufc.sanita.fvg.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Mercurio', 'firstname': 'Domenico', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, S.

Clinical and gait analysis studies have shown significant improvement after TAA. The role and outcomes of TAA in stiff ankles, which have little motion to be preserved, has been the subject of limited investigation. This investigation evaluated the mid- to long-term functional outcomes of TAA in stiff ankles.
A retrospective study of prospectively collected functional gait data in 33 TAA patients at a mean of 7.6 (5-13) years postoperatively used 1-way analysis of variance and multivariate regression analysis to compare among preoperative and postoperative demographic data (age, gender, body mass index, years postsurgery, and diagnosis) and gait parameters according to quartiles of preoperative sagittal ROM.
The stiffest ankles had a mean ROM of 7.8 degrees, compared to 14.3 degrees for the middle 2 quartiles, and 21.0 degrees for the most flexible ankles. Patients in the lowest quartile (Q1) also had statistically significantly lower step length, speed, max plantarflexion, and power preoperatively. Postoperatively, they increased step length, speed, max plantarflexion, and ankle power to levels comparable to patients with more flexible ankles preoperatively (Q2, Q3, and Q4). They had the greatest absolute and relative increases in these parameters of any group, but the final total ROM was still statistically significantly the lowest.
Preoperative ROM was predictive of overall postoperative gait function at an average of 7.6 (range 5-13) years. Although greater preoperative sagittal ROM predicted greater postoperative ROM, the stiffest ankles showed the greatest percentage increase in ROM. Patients with the stiffest ankles had the greatest absolute and relative improvements in objective function after TAA, as measured by multiple gait parameters. At intermediate- to long-term follow-up, patients with stiff ankles maintained significant functional improvements after TAA.

Comparing patient-reported outcome scores to the instrument's minimal important difference (MID) helps physicians and researchers infer whether a meaningful change in health from the patient's perspective has occurred following treatment. The objective of this study was to estimate the MID of the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale among a cohort of operatively treated end-stage ankle arthritis patients undergoing ankle replacement or arthrodesis.
A survey package including the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale was completed by participants preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. Distribution and anchor-based approaches to calculating the MID were used to estimate the MID of the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale and its 2 domains. The distribution-based approaches used were the small and medium effect size methods, while the mean absolute change method and linear regression method were the anchor-based approaches. Bootstrap sampling was used to obtain the variance of MID estimates. The MID was estimated for sex, age, operative, and baseline health subgroups. The cohort comprised 283 participants, totaling 298 ankles.
The MID did not vary with sex or operative procedure. Age-based differences in MID values may exist for the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale total score, and MID values were generally smallest among the oldest patients. Patients with the best and worst ankle-related health preoperatively had higher MID values than patients reporting mid-range Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale values preoperatively.
The best estimate of the MID of the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale total score is 5.81. Our findings indicate that the MID of the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale may not vary by sex or operative subgroups but likely varies by age and preoperative Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale score.

American volume|"In vivo gait analysis provides objective measurement of patient function and can quantify that function before and after ankle reconstruction. Previous gait studies have shown functional improvement for up to 4 years following total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), but to date, there are no published studies assessing function at ≥5 years following TAA. We hypothesized that patients who underwent TAA would show significant improvements in walking function at a minimum follow-up of 5 years, compared with their preoperative function, as measured by changes in temporospatial, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameters.
Three-dimensional gait analysis with a 12-camera digital motion-capture system and double force plates was utilized to record temporospatial, kinematic, and kinetic measures in 33 patients who underwent TAA with either the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (Stryker; n = 28) or Salto Talaris Ankle (Integra LifeSciences; n = 5). Gait analysis was performed preoperatively and at a minimum follow-up of 5 years (mean, 7.6 years; range, 5 to 13 years).
Significant improvements were observed in multiple gait parameters, with temporospatial increases in cadence (+9.5 steps/min; p < 0.0001), step length (+4.4 cm; p = 0.0013), and walking speed (+0.2 m/s; p < 0.0001), and kinematic increases in total sagittal range of motion (+2.0°; p = 0.0263), plantar flexion at initial contact (+2.7°; p = 0.0044), and maximum plantar flexion (+2.0°; p = 0.0488). Kinetic analysis revealed no loss of peak ankle power, despite patients aging.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report 7-year functional outcomes of TAA, quantified by objective, in vivo measurements of patient gait. Patients were shown to have sustained improvement in multiple objective parameters of gait compared with preoperative function.

Each is reproducible and valid, but they are entirely distinct methods. This study investigated the correlation between subjective and objective outcomes of TAA.
Seventy patients underwent gait analysis preoperatively and 1 year after TAA. The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and visual analog score (VAS) for pain and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scores were recorded at each interval. A Student 
Patients had statistically significant improvements in gait velocity, total range of motion (ROM), maximum plantarflexion, ankle power, and SF-36 Physical, VAS, and AOFAS scores. The SF-36 Physical score had a moderate positive correlation with preoperative walking speed, step length, and ankle power and postoperative walking speed and ankle power. No correlation between VAS score and function was detected. The AOFAS score had a moderate positive correlation with postoperative walking speed, step length, and ankle power, and improvement in walking speed, cadence, and ankle power.
Statistically significant correlations were found between numerous preoperative and postoperative comparisons of PROMs and the AOFAS score with the objective biomechanical outcomes of gait. Walking speed and ankle push-off power correlated most with patient perceptions of function and improvement, while pain and ROM did not. Subjective PROMs and objective biomechanical outcomes were complementary in the assessment of surgical outcomes and, combined, helped to address the dilemma of the confounding effect of other lower extremity pathologies on PROMs.

Nevertheless, gait studies continue to implement one-segment foot models to assess the effect of total ankle replacement.
The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of the foot modeling approach (one-segment versus multi-segment) on how total ankle replacement is estimated to benefit or degrade the patient's biomechanical performance.
Ten subjects with post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis scheduled for total ankle replacement and 10 asymptomatic subjects were recruited. A one-segment and a multi-segment foot model were used to calculate intrinsic foot joints kinematics and kinetics during gait. A linear mixed model was used to investigate the effect of the foot model on ankle joint kinematic and kinetic analysis and the effect of total ankle replacement.
Differences in range of motion due to the foot model effect were significant for all the gait subphases of interest except for midstance. Peak power generation was significantly overestimated when computed with the one-segment foot model. Ankle and shank-calcaneus joint dorsi-/plantarflexion range of motion did not increase post-operatively except during the loading response phase. A significant 'group' effect was found for stance and pre-swing phase range of motion, with total ankle replacement patients showing lower range of motion values than controls for dorsi/plantarflexion.
The outcome of this study showed that the 'foot model' had a significant effect on estimates of range of motion and power generation. The findings in our study therefore emphasize the clinical interest of multi-segment foot modeling when assessing the outcome of a therapeutic intervention."|||Differences in range of motion due to the foot model effect were significant for all the gait subphases of interest except for midstance.

However, this procedure has been associated with numerous complications and sequelae, such as pseudoarthrosis, malunion, gait abnormalities, increased demand on surrounding joints, and a long period of convalescence. Conversion to total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is a potential option in the management of these complex and challenging situations. The purpose of this study is to investigate the outcomes of AA conversion to TAA. A systematic review of electronic databases was performed. Six studies involving 172 ankles met inclusion criteria. The weighted mean preoperative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score at the time of TAA conversion was 7.8 and the weighted mean postoperative VAS score at the time of final follow-up was 2.5. The weighted mean preoperative AOFAS score at the time of TAA conversion was 32 and the weighted mean postoperative AOFAS score at the time of final follow-up was 72.4. The rate of salvage tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis was 2.3% and rate of transtibial amputation was also 2.3% after attempted conversion from initial AA to TAA. Conversion of AA to TAA appears to be a viable option to improve patient outcomes and prevent extensive hindfoot arthrodesis and transtibial amputation. More prospective studies with consistent reporting of outcomes, complications, and revision rates with long-term follow-up are needed.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

In cases of extensive disease, the insufficient blood supply leads to a high rate of complications including non-union after surgical treatment. This, in conjunction with the development of premature adjacent arthritis represents a challenge for the treating surgeon. Nowadays, total ankle arthroplasty is a reasonable option for the treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis with improved short- and long-term outcomes. We present a technique for patients with end-stage ankle arthritis associated to extensive talar osteonecrosis, and patients with prior total ankle replacement and talar component collapse due to AVN. This technique provides a more anatomic treatment for patients with severely deficient bone stock due to talar necrosis with ankle arthritis or failed ankle replacement.

The aim of this study was to test the intra- and interobserver reliability of these measurements.
This is a prospective study embedded within a multicentre cohort study. Following sample size calculation, 62 patients were analysed. Six measurements were performed on the first postoperative anteroposterior and lateral ankle radiographs: angles α and β, and length ""a"" defined the craniocaudal position of the tibial component, while angle γ, and lengths ""b"" and ""c"" defined the angular position of the talar component. Measurements were recorded by three independent observers. Inter- and intraobserver reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plots, and within-subject coefficients of variation (CV).
The intrarater ICC was ""almost perfect"" (ICC 0.83-0.97) for all six measurements. The interrater ICC was ""substantial"" to ""almost perfect"" (ICC 0.69-0.93). The mean difference in intrarater angular measurements was ≤ 0.6° and ≤ 0.8 mm for linear measurements, and ≤ 2.2° and ≤ 2.1 mm for interrater measurements. Maximum CV for the interrater linear measurements (≤ 17.7%) more than doubled that of the angular measurements (≤ 8.0%).

Additionally, there is a documented complication rate of up to 15.3% in such surgery. We have implemented a protective posteromedial approach that complements the anterior approach to reduce this risk of intraoperative iatrogenic injury. Using this method we introduce a protective instrument that separates the posterior anatomical structures from the posterior cortex of the tibia.

American volume|"Preoperative mental health and depression have been shown to negatively impact patient-reported outcome measures after a broad array of orthopaedic procedures including total ankle arthroplasty. The hypothesis for this study was that decreased Short Form (SF)-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores will modulate the impact of depression on patient-reported outcome measures after total ankle arthroplasty.
All patients undergoing primary total ankle arthroplasty between January 2007 and December 2016 who were enrolled into a prospective outcomes study and who had at least 1-year minimum study follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were separated into 4 groups based on the presence or absence of an SF-36 MCS score of <35 points and diagnosis of depression. SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and MCS scores, Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) function and bother components, and visual analog scale (VAS) pain were collected preoperatively and in the 1 to 2-year follow-up. The Wilcoxon rank sum was used to assess differences in outcomes by depression and low preoperative MCS scores. Multivariable models were then constructed to evaluate between-group differences in change scores according to preoperative SF-36 MCS scores and a diagnosis of depression, with adjustment for baseline patient and treatment characteristics.
Patients with depression and those with low preoperative MCS scores had significantly worse final outcome scores along with reduced improvement in SF-36 PCS and VAS pain scores compared with patients without these risk factors. Among patients with depression, low preoperative MCS scores helped to differentiate patients with poor final outcome scores. Similarly, in patients with low preoperative MCS scores, depression helped to differentiate patients with poor final outcome scores.
Although patients achieved significant improvements in functional outcomes regardless of cohort, decreased preoperative mental health modulated the impact of depression on outcomes. Patients with diminished preoperative mental health and depression are at an increased risk for sustaining smaller improvements in outcomes.

The PearlDiver Patient Records Database was queried to identify all patients who underwent an arthroscopic/open AA or TAA from 2006 to 2013. The two cohorts were then matched in a 1:1 manner to control for comorbidities and demographics. Postoperative complications were compared between the two cohorts, in addition to the associated costs with respect to each procedure.
No significant differences in risk for postoperative complications were noted between the two procedures with the numbers available. Significant differences were demonstrated in total length of hospital stay (LOS), with a mean of 2.13 days for the TAA cohort and 2.42 days for the AA cohort (p < 0.001). Higher mean total hospital costs were noted for TAA (x¯ = $62,416.62) compared to AA (x¯ = $37,737.43, p < 0.001); however, TAA was associated with a higher mean total reimbursement (x¯ = $12,254.43) than AA (x¯ = $7915.72, p < 0.001).
With no notable differences in 30-day complication rates, TAA remains a viable alternative to AA in the appropriately selected patient and provides the ability to preserve tibiotalar motion resulting in superior functional scores.

Additionally, TAA demonstrated higher total costs to implant, but also greater reimbursement, in line with the recent literature suggesting TAA to be a cost-effective alternative to AA.||No significant differences in risk for postoperative complications were noted between the two procedures with the numbers available. Significant differences were demonstrated in total length of hospital stay (LOS), with a mean of 2.13 days for the TAA cohort and 2.42 days for the AA cohort (p < 0.001). Higher mean total hospital costs were noted for TAA (x¯ = $62,416.62) compared to AA (x¯ = $37,737.43, p < 0.001); however, TAA was associated with a higher mean total reimbursement (x¯ = $12,254.43) than AA (x¯ = $7915.72, p < 0.001).|Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the load-controlled testing parameters were applied to cadaveric specimens to quantify and compare the observed sagittal translations and axial rotations to those specified under the displacement-controlled option. Twelve cadaveric specimens were stripped of extraneous tissues, keeping surrounding ankle ligaments. A halo was used to produce plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the talus through two screws, while a baseplate resisted axial loads. The axial force and torque were applied to the tibia and fibula under force and torque feedback control. An anterior-posterior force was applied to the tibia. Plantarflexion-dorsiflexion were applied using rotation control. To protect the cadaveric specimens, loads were applied at 50% of the specified load profile while plantarflexion-dorsiflexion rotation was applied as specified. There was variation among specimens in magnitudes of anterior-posterior displacement with peaks ranging from 3.3 mm posteriorly to 3.0 mm anteriorly. Likewise, there was variation among specimens in magnitude of axial rotation, with peaks ranging from 11° external rotation to 4.5° internal rotation. However, the mean magnitudes of AP displacement and axial rotation did not exceed those specified by ISO 22622.||||© 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

A matched cohort of patients similar for demographics and components used but differing in preoperative coronal-plane tibiotalar valgus deformity ≥ 15° (valgus, n = 50; 52% male, mean age 65.8 years (SD 10.3), mean body mass index (BMI) 29.4 (SD 5.2)) or < 15° (control, n = 50; 58% male, mean age 65.6 years (SD 9.8), mean BMI 28.7 (SD 4.2)), underwent TAA by one surgeon. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs, Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) pain and disability and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) version 2 scores were collected prospectively. Ancillary procedures, secondary procedures, and complications were recorded.
At mean 5.1 years follow-up (SD 2.6) (valgus) and 6.6 years (SD 3.3) (controls), mean AOS scores decreased and SF-36 scores increased significantly in both groups.

57|33247851|Talar neck angle correlates with tibial torsion-Guidance for 3D and 2D measurements in total ankle replacement.|['extramedullary referencing', 'talar neck torsion', 'total ankle replacement']|Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society|Axial plane alignment of the talar component in total ankle arthroplasty is poorly understood and remains a major issue, especially since malpositioning results in increased peak pressure and rotational torque. Further profound knowledge regarding individual anatomy of the talus and its relation to proximal and distal osseous structures is therefore needed. Therefore, three-dimensional (3D) surface models of 50 lower extremities were generated using computed tomography data of patients without ankle osteoarthritis. The talus neck torsion was measured using a novel 3D measurement method. Then, tibial torsion and subtalar joint axis orientation were measured and correlated to the talus neck torsion. Moreover, a 2D measurement method of the talus neck torsion was developed. A statistically significant correlation was found between external tibia torsion and medial talus neck torsion, as well as talus neck axis and subtalar joint axis in the transversal and frontal plane. The novel defined 3D measurement methods indicated excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. The 2D measurement method of the talus neck torsion was in good agreement with the 3D method. The results showed that the rotational profiles of the tibia, talus, and adjacent joints are interconnected, which should be considered in total ankle replacement (TAR). Clinical relevance: This study improves the overall understanding of the talar anatomy, as well as its relationship to adjacent osseous structures. The novel 2D measurement method of the talus neck torsion might improve talar component positioning in the axial plane corresponding to the patient's individual anatomy, and therefore improve the survival rate of TAR.||||© 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients who underwent total ankle replacement between January 2010 and June 2018. Following joint replacement, the patients received iNPWT (iNPWT group) or sterile dressings (Control group). Infection rate, wound complication incidence, length of stay, visual analogue scale, American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society, and short-form 36 scales, and ankle range of motion were assessed 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. Thirty-four patients (n = 13 iNPWT and n = 21 Control) were included. No significant differences were found in baseline data. During follow-up, one Control patient developed a superficial infection at the incision. Wound complications developed in 4 Control patients and 1 iNPWT patient; although this was not statistically significant. Length of stay was similar between the 2 groups. Two weeks after surgery, the range of visual analogue scale (2.1 vs 1.4), American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (13.7 vs 9.7), and short-form 36 scale (9.0 vs 6.5) improvement, and increase of ankle range of motion (9.2 vs 6.1) was significantly larger in the study group than in the control group (p < .05). Three months to 1 year after the surgery, this difference was no longer statistically significant. The application of iNPWT following total ankle arthroplasty helped reduce postoperative pain, improve ankle function, and improve patient quality of life. However, these benefits were no longer statistically significant 3 months to 1 year after surgery.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The plantarflexion moment arm of the Achilles tendon is a critical determinant of ankle function with the potential to be altered by TAA. Here we investigate the effect of TAA on Achilles tendon moment arm assessed using two methods. Standing sagittal-plane radiographs were obtained for ten patients presurgery and postsurgery, from which anterior-posterior distance between the posterior calcaneus and the center of the talar dome was measured. Ultrasound imaging and three-dimensional (3D) motion capture were used to obtain moment arm pre- and post-TAA. The absolute changes in moment arm pre- to post-TAA were significantly different from zero for both methods (9.6 mm from ultrasound and 4.6% of the calcaneus length from radiographs).

Numerous orthopedic centers have entered the healthcare market offering fast-tracked joint replacement protocols, meanwhile, TAA has been excluded from these joint centers, and is primarily performed in the inpatient setting. The purpose of this study is to examine short-term complications in the inpatient and outpatient settings following TAA using a systematic review and quantitative analysis. We considered all studies examining short-term complications following TAA performed in the inpatient versus outpatient setting occuring within 1 year of the index operation. We summarized data using a pooled relative risk and random effects model. A pooled sensitivity analysis was performed for studies with data on complication rates for inpatient or outpatient populations, which did not have a control group. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Nine studies were included in the quantitative analysis, with 4 studies in the final meta-analysis. Subjects undergoing inpatient surgery experienced a 5-times higher risk of short-term complications compared to the outpatient group (risk ratio 5.27, 95% confidence interval 3.31, 8.42). Results did not change after sensitivity analysis (inpatient weighted mean complication rate: 9.62% vs outpatient weighted mean 5.02%, p value <.001). The overall level of evidence of included studies was level III, with a moderate to high risk of bias. Outpatient TAAs do not appear to pose excess complication risks compared to inpatient procedures, and may therefore be a reasonable addition to experienced centers that have established a fast-track outpatient total joint protocol.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of LBP in people undergoing TAA and analyze its impact on patient reported functional outcome measures (PROMs). A retrospective review was performed on data from the Vancouver End Stage Ankle Arthritis Database. In total, 87 patients undergoing TAA were studied, with patient demographics collected preoperatively, including the absence or presence of LBP. Postoperative follow-up was performed at 5 years, primarily analyzing disease-specific PROMs including the Ankle Osteoarthritis Score and Ankle Arthritis Score. The Short Form-36 was used as a secondary outcome measure to assess global function. Multivariable linear mixed-effects regression models were conducted to compare the PROM between patients with LBP with those without LBP. In total, 30 patients (35%) presented with concomitant LBP. There were no significant differences at baseline between the LBP group and no LBP group in terms of demographics or baseline primary disease-specific PROMs. At 5 years, the patients with LBP had significantly worse Ankle Arthritis Score (32 ± 23 vs 22 ± 17, p = .03), Ankle Osteoarthritis Score Total (34 ± 23 vs 22 ± 16, p = .01), and Short Form-36 physical (PCS) components summaries (33 ± 12 vs 44 ± 9, p = .001) compared to the no-LBP group. Both groups improved significantly from baseline across all outcome measures. Our study demonstrated that the prevalence of concomitant LBP in end stage ankle arthritis undergoing TAA is similar to that described in arthritic knees and hips. If present, it can be associated with worse functional outcomes in the intermediate term. However it is not a contraindication to surgery, with patients still experiencing significant improvements from baseline. Further studies are needed to evaluate if LBP influences complications, implant failure rates and survival.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Previous studies have looked at the effects of these procedures on total tibiopedal motion. However, tibiopedal motion includes motion of the midfoot and hindfoot as well as the ankle replacement. The current study examined the effects of Achilles tendon lengthening and gastrocnemius recession on radiographic tibiotalar motion at the level of the prosthesis only.
Fifty-four patients with an average of 25 months follow-up after total ankle replacement were divided into 3 groups: (1) patients who underwent Achilles tendon lengthening, (2) patients who had a gastrocnemius recession, (3) patients with no lengthening procedure. Tibiotalar range of motion was measured on lateral dorsiflexion-plantarflexion radiographs using reference lines on the surface of the implants.
Both Achilles tendon lengthening and gastrocnemius recession significantly increased tibiotalar dorsiflexion when compared to the group without lengthening. However, the total tibiotalar range of motion among the 3 groups was the same. Interestingly, the Achilles tendon lengthening group lost 11.7 degrees of plantarflexion compared to the group without lengthening, which was significant.
Both Achilles tendon lengthening and gastrocnemius recession increased radiographic tibiotalar dorsiflexion following arthroplasty. Achilles tendon lengthening had the unexpected effect of significantly decreasing plantarflexion. Gastrocnemius recession may be a better choice when faced with a tight ankle replacement because it increases dorsiflexion without a compensatory loss of plantarflexion.

Several studies have shown that low bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip affects the longevity of prosthetic implants. The role of Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry for TAA has not been established. The purpose of this review was to define the role of BMD in TAA outcomes and the role of Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in measuring periprosthetic BMD. There is a paucity of information and published literature regarding the relationship between BMD and TAA. From attempting this systematic review, we hope to highlight that much of the focus in total ankle arthroplasty has emphasized implants and relatively little has focused on the quality of bone into which the prostheses are implanted.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

We describe a case series of patients treated with external and internal fixation techniques followed by total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) in a staged approach to treat this complex presentation.
Eight patients with limb deformity and end-stage ankle OA who underwent staged deformity correction and TAA from 2016 to 2019 at our institution were retrospectively identified. Average age was 58.5 (range, 49-68) years, with an average follow-up of 2.6 (range, 0.8-4.2) years. All patients underwent limb reconstruction with either tibial osteotomy with a circular frame (n=6) or intramedullary nail (n=2). Limb deformities consisted of the following: posttraumatic tibial malunion (2), limb length discrepancy (1), acquired tibial deformity (1), genu varum (2), or genu valgum (2). Radiographic parameters were assessed pre- and postoperatively on 51-inch standing and ankle radiographs: limb length discrepancy (LLD), genu varum/valgum deformity, recurvatum deformity, mechanical axis deviation, medial proximal tibial angle, lateral distal tibial angle, anterior distal tibial angle, and tibiotalar alignment. Pre- and postoperative patient-reported outcomes were assessed using 2 metrics, the Limb Deformity-Scoliosis Research Society (LD-SRS) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores (Physical Function, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, Global Physical Function, and Global Mental Function).
Following staged limb deformity correction and TAA, all patients achieved correction of LLD and angular deformities of the lower limb, along with restoration of normal alignment of the ankle joint. There was significant mean improvement in all patient-reported LD-SRS and PROMIS domains, except for LD-SRS mental health. LD-SRS function improved from 2.6 (±0.7) to 4.6 (±0.2), 
Deformity correction with either external frame or intramedullary nail fixation followed by TAA in a staged approach was a viable surgical option in the treatment of end-stage ankle OA with concurrent extra-articular limb deformity.

Historically, the anterior incision has demonstrated a high incidence of complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate anterior incisional healing and soft tissue complications between TAR and ankle arthrodesis with anterior plate fixation.This was an IRB-approved retrospective review of wound healing and other complications among 304 patients who underwent primary TAR (191 patients) or ankle arthrodesis (113 patients) via the anterior approach over a 4-year period. The operative approach, intraoperative soft tissue handling, and postoperative protocol for the first 30 days were the same between groups. The mean follow-up was 11.8 months. To diminish the effect of selection bias, a subgroup analysis was performed comparing 91 TAR patients matched to an equal number of demographically similar ankle arthrodesis patients. Overall, 19.7% of patients experienced delayed wound healing greater than 30 days. Although the TAR and arthrodesis subgroups had dissimilar demographics, there was no difference in outcomes. Between matched pairs, no statistically significant differences were observed; however, trends were identified with matched cohort groups when compared to the overall patient series. These trends toward statistically significant differences in delayed wound healing and incidence of wound care in the matched cohort groups warrants further investigation in larger series or multicenter study. Further work is needed to identify the modifiable risk factors associated with the anterior ankle incision.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The purpose of the present study was to identify independent risk factors for the early failure of fourth generation TAA prostheses. A total of 97 ankles underwent TAA with a fourth generation prostheses (INFINITY, CADENCE) between August 2015 and June 2018 at a single institution and were at least 6 months postoperative (mean 18.3 months, range 6-43). The primary outcome assessed was the need for revision surgery, defined as removal of 1 or both metal components for any reason, excluding infection. Baseline patient demographics, characteristics, radiographic alignment parameters, and distal tibia cortical bone thickness (CBT) were assessed. Revisions, reoperations, and complications were classified according to the criteria established by Vander Griend et al and Glazebrook et al, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Three ankles (3.1%) underwent revision surgery for aseptic loosening at a mean of 24.3 (range, 16-31) months; all had a CBT <4 mm. Independent predictors for reoperation were CBT <4 mm, presence of diabetes, and ipsilateral hindfoot fusion (p = .04). No associations were identified for purported risk factors (age, body mass index, and coronal deformity). The present study is the first to suggest a potential relationship between reduced CBT of the distal tibia, and TAA failure. Additional studies are warranted to better understand the role of bone density in TAA survivorship.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Patients are subclassified into mild, moderate and severe disease based on per cent factor activity level. Nearly, all patients with haemophilia develop haemophilic arthropathy (HA) by age 30 and HA is known to have a negative impact on physical health subscores in Haem-A-QOL, a validated quality of life scoring system for patients with haemophilia. Unfortunately, many patients progress to end-stage HA of the ankle, which is characterized by pain, contractures, decreased range of motion and muscle atrophy. Ankle arthrodesis (AAD) has been the standard of care in the definitive surgical management of end-stage HA of the ankle. While AAD is a safe surgical procedure known to improve HA-related pain, it decreases functional mobility and has been associated with secondary hindfoot arthritis as well as subtalar degeneration. In recent years, total ankle replacement (TAR) has emerged as an alternative surgical procedure that strives to improve functional mobility, pain and quality of life in end-stage HA of the ankle. However, the safety, durability, and efficacy of this procedure in these patients are unknown. In this review, we analyse the clinical studies investigating TAR in patients with end-stage HA of the ankle. We also discuss important considerations in the perioperative management of patients with haemophilia and compare the risks and benefits of AAD and TAR for patients with end-stage HA of the ankle.||||© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.|10.1111/hae.14196|2020-11-10|[{'lastname': 'Sackstein', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cooper', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kessler', 'firstname': 'Craig', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA.\nLombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.'}]

Innovations in implant structure design may ideally reduce micromotion at the bone-implant interface and enhance the bone-implant fixation and initial stability, thus eventually prevents long-term implant loosening. This study aimed to investigate (1) biomechanical characteristics at the bone-implant interface and (2) the influence of design features, such as radius, height, and length.
A total of 101 finite-element models were created based on four commercially available implants. The models predicted micromotion at the bone-implant interface, and we investigated the impact of structural parameters, such as radius, length, and height.
Our results suggested that stem-type implants generally required the highest volume of bone resection before implantation, while peg-type implants required the lowest. Compared with central fixation features (stem and keel), peripherally distributed geometries (bar and peg) were associated with lower initial micromotions. The initial stability of all types of implant design can be optimized by decreasing fixation size, such as reducing the radius of the bars and pegs and lowering the height.
Peg-type tibial implant design may be a promising fixation method, which is required with a minimum bone resection volume and yielded minimum micromotion under an extreme axial loading scenario. Present models can serve as a useful platform to build upon to help physicians or engineers when making incremental improvements related to implant design."|Peg-type tibial implant design may be a promising fixation method, which is required with a minimum bone resection volume and yielded minimum micromotion under an extreme axial loading scenario.

Part I: Joint loads during simulated level walking.|['ankle', 'biomechanics', 'joint reaction loads', 'musculoskeletal modeling', 'total ankle arthroplasty']|Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society|In total ankle arthroplasty, the interaction at the joint between implant and bone is driven by a complex loading environment. Unfortunately, little is known about the loads at the ankle during daily activities since earlier attempts use two- or three-dimensional models to explore simplified joint mechanics. Our goal was to develop a framework to calculate multi-axial loads at the joint during simulated level walking following total ankle arthroplasty. To accomplish this, we combined robotic simulations of level walking at one-quarter bodyweight in three cadaveric foot and ankle specimens with musculoskeletal modeling to calculate the multi-axial forces and moments at the ankle during the stance phase. The peak compressive forces calculated were between 720 and 873 N occurring around 77%-80% of stance. The peak moment, which was the internal moment for all specimens, was between 6.1 and 11.6 N m and occurred between 72% and 88% of the stance phase. The peak moment did not necessarily occur with the peak force. The ankle joint loads calculated in this study correspond well to previous attempts in the literature; however, our robotic simulator and framework provide an opportunity to resolve the resultant three-dimensional forces and moments as others have not in previous studies. The framework may be useful to calculate ankle joint loads in cadaveric specimens as the first step in evaluating bone-implant interactions in total ankle replacement using specimen specific inputs. This approach also provides a unique opportunity to evaluate changes in joint loads and kinematics following surgical interventions of the foot and ankle.||||© 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine|Extreme bone resorption due to bone remodelling is one of the reasons for ankle component loosening. Finite element (FE) analysis has been effectively used nowadays for pre-clinical analysis of orthopaedic implants. For FE modelling, the selection of bone material and dead zone play a vital role to understand the bone remodelling. This study deals with the effects of different cancellous elastic modulus-density relationships and dead zone on bone remodelling around the tibia owing to total ankle replacement (TAR), using finite element analysis with physiological loading conditions. This study also investigated the bone stimulus distribution in the tibia to identify the initial indication of bone density changes due to bone remodelling. Additionally, the Hoffman failure criterion was used to investigate the chances of implant-bone interface failure due to different cancellous bone material modelling and bone remodelling. The present bone remodelling study consists of three different dead or lazy zones (±0.75, ±0.60 and ±0.35) to examine the influence of the dead zone on bone remodelling. Differences in stress/strain distribution were observed in the tibia bone due to different cancellous bone material modelling. Despite little variations, bone density changes due to bone remodelling were found to be almost similar for two FE models having different cancellous bone material. Similar to these results, the effect of different dead zone on bone density changes due to bone remodelling was found to be minimal. Bone stimulus distribution in the cancellous bone was found to be almost similar for FE models having different cancellous bone material modelling and different dead zones. To understand the stress/strain and interface related failure of the tibial component, cancellous bone material modelling plays a crucial role. However, cancellous bone material modelling and dead zone have minimal influence on bone remodelling around the tibia cancellous bone due to TAR.|||||10.1177/0954411920967775|2020-11-04|[{'lastname': 'Mondal', 'firstname': 'Subrata', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghosh', 'firstname': 'Rajesh', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India.'}]

The purpose of the present study was to present early experience with the CADENCE total ankle prosthesis. All patients who underwent primary total ankle arthroplasty using the prosthesis between August 2016 and June 2018 at a single institution and who were at least 1 year postoperative were included. A total of 32 ankles with a mean follow-up of 24 (range, 12-33) months met the criteria. Weightbearing radiographs were assessed using coronal and sagittal alignment parameters preoperatively, at 6 weeks postoperative, and at the most recent follow-up. Medical records and charts were reviewed and revisions, reoperations, and complications were classified according to the criteria established by Vander Griend et al and Glazebrook et el, respectively. Coronal and sagittal tibiotalar alignment significantly improved after surgery (p < .001, p < .005), and was maintained during the latest follow-up (p = .44, p = .30). Two (6.3%) ankles underwent early revision for aseptic loosening; while 6 (18.8%) underwent a nonrevisional reoperation. Nine (28.1%) ankles presented a total of 13 (4 high grade, 2 intermediate, and 7 low) complications according to the Glazebrook classification. The most common was intraoperative periprosthetic medial malleolar fracture (5 ankles, 15.6%), a low-grade complication. The present study is the first to report early outcomes and experience with the CADENCE total ankle. Overall, survivorship was 94% at short-term follow-up of 2 years. As with all arthroplasty devices, surgeons new to the prosthesis should be cognizant of the potential learning curve. Intraoperative medial malleolar fracture was found to be the most common complication.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

78|33105302|What Are the Indications for Implant Revision in Three-component Total Ankle Arthroplasty?|[]|Clinical orthopaedics and related research|"Given the increasing usage of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), a better understanding of the reasons leading to implant revision and the factors that might influence those indications is necessary to identify at-risk patients.
Using a single-design three-component ankle prosthesis, we asked: (1) What is the cumulative incidence of implant revision at 5 and 10 years? (2) What are the indications for implant revision in our population? (3) What factors are associated with an increased likelihood of implant revision during the time frame in question?
Between 2003 and 2017, primary TAA using a single-design three-component ankle implant was performed by or under the supervision of the implant designer in 1006 patients (1074 ankles) aged between 17 and 88 years to treat end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. No other TAA systems were used during the study period at the investigators' institution. In 68 patients with bilateral surgery, only the first TAA was considered. Of the patients treated with the study implant, 2% (16 of 1006) were lost to follow-up 5 to 14 years after TAA and were not known to have died or undergone revision, and 5% (55 of 1006) were deceased due to reasons unrelated to the procedure, leaving 935 patients for evaluation in this retrospective study. The mean (range) follow-up for the included patients was 8.8 ± 4.2 (0.2 to 16.8) years. Implant revision was performed 0.5 to 13.2 years after TAA in 12% (121 of 1006) of our patients. Survivorship free from revision was calculated using cumulative incidence (competing risks) survivorship, with death as a competing risk. The reason for each revision was classified into one of six categories according to a modified version of a previously published protocol: aseptic loosening, cyst formation, instability, deep infection, technical error, and pain without another cause. Two foot and ankle surgeons reviewed the records of all patients who underwent implant revision and assigned each patient's reason for revision to one of the six categories. The decision for assigning each patient to one of the six categories was made based on a consensus agreement. A subgroup classification of preoperative ankle alignment (neutral, mild, and major deformity) and variables of age, sex, BMI, etiology of ankle osteoarthritis, and number of preoperative and intraoperative hindfoot or midfoot procedures were used in a multinomial logistic regression and Cox regression analysis to estimate their association with reason for revision and implant survival until revision.
The cumulative incidence of implant revision at the mean (range) follow-up time of 8.8 ± 4.2 years (0.2 to 16.8) was 9.8% (95% confidence interval 7.7% to 11.8%). Five and 10 years after TAA, cumulative incidence was 4.8% (95% CI 3.4 to 6.1) and 12.1% (95% CI 9.7% to 14.5%), respectively. The most common reason for revision was instability (34% [41 of 121]), followed by aseptic loosening of one or more metallic components (28% [34 of 121]), pain without another cause (12% [14 of 121]), cyst formation (10% [12 of 121]), deep infection (9% [11 of 121]), and technical error (7% [9 of 121]). Ankles with a major hindfoot deformity before TAA were more likely to undergo revision than ankles with a minor deformity (hazard ratio 1.9 [95% CI 1.2 to 3.0]; p = 0.007) or neutral alignment (HR 2.5 [95% CI 1.5 to 4.4]; p = 0.001). A preoperative hindfoot valgus deformity increased revision probability compared with a varus deformity (HR 2.1 [95% CI 1.4 to 3.4]; p = 0.001).
Instability was a more common reason for implant revision after TAA with this three-component design than previously reported. All causes inducing either a varus or valgus hindfoot deformity must be meticulously addressed during TAA to prevent revision of this implant. Future studies from surgeons/institutions not involved in this implant design are needed to confirm these findings and to further investigate why a substantial number of patients had pain of unknown cause prompting revision.

In particular, once tibialis anterior (TA) tendon is exposed from tendon sheath of extensor retinaculum, wound healing will be critically intractable. We report three cases (mean age: 75.3 years old) of delayed wound healing after TAA cured by resection of TA tendon in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All three cases underwent TAA through an anterior approach, with careful suture of extensor retinaculum in wound closure. Ankle joint was fixed with splint and avoid weight bearing for three weeks after surgery. Delayed wound healing with TA tendon exposure was observed, and initially treated by debridement, basic fibroblast growth factor spray, and negative pressure wound therapy, which all failed to obtain wound healing. Finally, complete resection of TA tendon led to rapid wound healing. In all cases, ankle dorsal flexion was compensated by other extensors, with maintained range of motion and muscle strength (manual muscle testing 3 to 4) compared to pre-operation at 1 year after TAA operation. Resection of TA tendon may be considered as one of the salvage treatment options of severe delayed wound healing in TAA with anterior approach, especially in elderly patients.|||||10.1080/24725625.2019.1641297|2020-10-23|[{'lastname': 'Etani', 'firstname': 'Yuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ebina', 'firstname': 'Kosuke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Musculoskeletal Regenerative Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hirao', 'firstname': 'Makoto', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Miyama', 'firstname': 'Akira', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hashimoto', 'firstname': 'Jun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rheumatology, National Hospital Organization Osaka Minami Medical Center, Kawachinagano, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Noguchi', 'firstname': 'Takaaki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National Hospital Organization Osaka Minami Medical Center, Kawachinagano, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okamura', 'firstname': 'Gensuke', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takami', 'firstname': 'Kenji', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshikawa', 'firstname': 'Hideki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.'}]

Part II: Influence of loading and fixation design on tibial bone-implant interaction.|['bone failure', 'finite element analysis', 'micromotion', 'total ankle arthroplasty']|Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society|Finite element (FE) models to evaluate the burden placed on the interaction between total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) implants and the bone often rely on peak axial forces. However, the loading environment of the ankle is complex, and it is unclear whether peak axial forces represent a challenging scenario for the interaction between the implant and the bone. Our goal was to determine how the loads and the design of the fixation of the tibial component of TAA impact the interaction between the implant and the bone. To this end, we developed a framework that integrated robotic cadaveric simulations to determine the ankle kinematics, musculoskeletal models to determine the ankle joint loads, and FE models to evaluate the interaction between TAA and the bone. We compared the bone-implant micromotion and the risk of bone failure of three common fixation designs for the tibial component of TAA: spikes, a stem, and a keel. We found that the most critical conditions for the interaction between the implant and the bone were dependent on the specimen and the fixation design, but always involved submaximal forces and large moments. We also found that while the fixation design influenced the distribution and the peak value of bone-implant micromotion, the amount of bone at risk of failure was specimen dependent. To account for the most critical conditions for the interaction between the implant and the bone, our results support simulating multiple specimens under complex loading profiles that include multiaxial moments and span entire activity cycles.||||© 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The challenge for the surgeon is to determine which patients may benefit from these joint-preserving procedures. We hypothesized that patents with less than 2 mm of ankle joint space on preoperative radiographs would report inferior outcomes following joint-preserving surgery compared with those with 2 mm or greater joint space.
Patients 18 years of age or older treated with joint-preserving ankle surgery with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up were considered for study inclusion. The ankle joint space was measured on standardized weightbearing preoperative radiographs. At follow-up, patients completed questionnaires including the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Sports subscales, the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary, the Tegner Activity Scale, and satisfaction with outcome.

However, little is known about the functional outcome associated to different prosthesis designs. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare clinical and functional outcomes via gait analysis of two ankle prostheses designed to preserve ankle ligamentous isometry.
Two groups of twenty patients who underwent ankle arthroplasty using either a three-component or a two-component prosthesis, were clinically evaluated, both pre-operatively and at minimal 2-year follow-up, by means of the AOFAS score. The spatio-temporal parameters, along with the kinetics and kinematics of the lower limb joints were also assessed at follow-up via gait analysis. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences in functional data between the two patient groups and with respect to those from a control group of 20 healthy subjects.
All AOFAS scores significantly improved from pre-operative to post-operative assessment in both patient groups (P < 0.05). Most spatio-temporal and functional parameters in the patients were worse than those in the control group, but no significant differences were observed between the two arthroplasty groups.
Both patient groups showed improved clinical outcome at follow-up, with a few differences in gait parameters. However, neither of the two groups achieved normal locomotion patterns. Since both prostheses were designed to preserve ligamentous isometry, the choice of one implant over the other should be due to preferences in the surgical approach and to other patient-specific factors."||||Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The combined 3D custom total ankle-total talus replacement (TATTR) is used for patients with an unreconstructable talus and adjacent tibial plafond involvement. The goal of performing a TATTR is to provide pain relief, retain motion at the tibiotalar joint, maintain or improve the patient's functional status, and minimize limb shortening. TATTR is made possible by 3D printing. The advent of 3D printing has allowed for the accurate recreation of the native talar anatomy with a talar dome that can be matched to a total ankle replacement polyethylene bearing.

It is unclear whether this is a pathologic immunologic process in response to wear debris, or expansion of pre-existing osteoarthritic bone cysts. We aimed to determine the incidence of bone cysts in patients with end-stage ankle arthritis prior to surgery and review the literature on bone cysts and osteolysis in relation to TAR.
This is a descriptive/prevalence study in which all patients with end-stage ankle arthritis underwent plain radiographic imaging and computed tomographic (CT) scans prior to TAR surgery. Their imaging was assessed for the presence of cysts, measured on sagittal, axial, and coronal slices of the CT scan at the widest diameter. All cysts that would be removed as a result of the bone resection for the implant were excluded using digital analysis software. We assessed 120 consecutive patients with mean age of 63.4 years.
Seventeen patients (14%) did not have any bone cysts based on CT images. Ten patients (8%) had cysts that would have been completely removed by surgery, leaving 93 patients for analysis (78%). In 60% of these cases, the cysts were not seen on the plain radiographs. In 39 patients (33%), the cysts were greater than 5 mm in size. The medial (36%) and lateral malleoli (33%) were the most common location for the cysts (mean diameter 4.6±2.0 and 4.2±2.3 mm, respectively).

Historically, surgical options have been limited and can leave patients with little ankle motion and have high failure rates. The use of custom 3D printed total talar replacements (TTRs) has arisen as a treatment option for these patients, possibly allowing better preservation of hindfoot motion. We hypothesized that patients undergoing TTR will demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) at 1 year after surgery.
We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients who underwent a TTR over a 2-year period. Patient outcomes were reviewed, including age, sex, comorbidities, etiology of talar pathology, number and type of prior surgeries, radiographic alignment, FAOS and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and range of motion. Data analysis was performed with Student t-tests and multivariate regression.
FAOSs and VAS scores showed statistically significant improvements postoperatively as compared with preoperative scores. There was a statistically significant decrease in VAS pain scores from 7.0 preoperatively to 3.6 (P < .001). Average follow-up was 12.8 months.

However, very little is known about the path of the center of pressure (COP) of the foot, and thus important aspects of load transfer, muscle mechanical advantage, and balance, in patients before or after surgery. The objective of this study was to trace the pathway of the COP under the foot in patients with symptomatic ankle OA, comparing asymmetry between affected and unaffected limbs. From force plate data, proximodistal and mediolateral positions of the COP beneath the foot were calculated and compared for the affected and unaffected foot in patients with unilateral ankle OA (N = 93) before and after TAA. Gender and age at surgery had little or no effect in this study. Patients with ankle OA had minimal COP position asymmetry before surgery, and this asymmetry was reduced following surgery. Before surgery, patients had a slower walking speed and a shorter path of the COP which began relatively distal to the heel and ended relatively proximal to the hallux. TAA increased the proximodistal distance the COP traveled under both the unaffected and affected foot, a pattern that was maintained for over 2-year postsurgery. TAA allows patients with ankle OA to maintain a longer COP path than they had before surgery on both sides that is closer to that reported for unaffected individuals, extending effectively from the heel to the hallux, potentially improving pedal mechanics.||||© 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The purpose of this paper is to present a new and complete total ankle arthroplasty customization process for severe posttraumatic ankle joint arthritis, consisting of patient-specific 3D-printed implant and instrumentation, starting from a ligament-compatible design.
The new customization process was proposed in a 57-year-old male patient and involved image analysis, joint modeling, prosthesis design, patient-specific implant and instrumentation development, relevant prototyping, manufacturing, and implantation. Images obtained from a CT scan were processed for a 3D model of the ankle, and the BOX ankle prosthesis (MatOrtho, UK) geometries were customized to best fit the model. Virtual in silico, i.e., at the computer, implantation was performed to optimize positioning of these components. Corresponding patient-specific cutting guides for bone preparation were designed. The obtained models were printed in ABS by additive manufacturing for a final check. Once the planning procedure was approved, the models were sent to final state-of-the-art additive manufacturing (the metal components using cobalt-chromium-molybdenum powders, and the guides using polyamide). The custom-made prosthesis was then implanted using the cutting guides. The design, manufacturing, and implantation procedures were completed successfully and consistently, and final dimensions and location for the implant corresponded with the preoperative plan. Immediate post-op X-rays showed good implant positioning and alignment. After 4 months, clinical scores and functional abilities were excellent. Gait analysis showed satisfactory joint moment at the ankle complex and muscle activation timing within normality.
The complete customization process for total ankle arthroplasty provided accurate and reliable implant positioning, with satisfactory short-term clinical outcomes. However, further studies are needed to confirm the potential benefits of this complete customization process.

Current literature describing metal allergy in orthopaedics is limited with there being no report to date on metal allergy after total ankle arthroplasty. Our patient underwent a total ankle arthroplasty and developed a diffuse rash 7 weeks postoperatively. The patient then tested positive for a metal allergy and ultimately was converted to an arthrodesis. In the setting of postoperative pain, swelling, erythema, or rash, it is important that metal allergy be on the differential diagnosis. Interestingly, when the patient here underwent allergy testing, only the articulating sides of the implant caused a positive reaction. Thus, allergy testing of both the articular and nonarticular sides of the component is of the utmost importance, as evidenced by the discrepancy found in this case.|||||10.1177/1938640020950119|2020-08-26|[{'lastname': 'Gaston', 'firstname': 'Tara E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, Stratford, New Jersey (TEG, SK, HES).\nRothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (QTC, JND).'}, {'lastname': 'Kwan', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, Stratford, New Jersey (TEG, SK, HES).\nRothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (QTC, JND).'}, {'lastname': 'Skibicki', 'firstname': 'Hope E', 'initials': 'HE', 'affiliation': 'Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, Stratford, New Jersey (TEG, SK, HES).\nRothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (QTC, JND).'}, {'lastname': 'Cheesman', 'firstname': 'Quincy T', 'initials': 'QT', 'affiliation': 'Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, Stratford, New Jersey (TEG, SK, HES).\nRothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (QTC, JND).'}, {'lastname': 'Daniel', 'firstname': 'Joseph N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, Stratford, New Jersey (TEG, SK, HES).\nRothman Orthopaedic Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (QTC, JND).'}]

Limited literature is available on options and outcomes of revision arthroplasty despite failure rates ranging from 10% to 23% within 10 years after primary TAA. This study reports the clinical and radiographic outcomes of revision TAA using a fixed-bearing, intramedullary-referencing implant.
A retrospective review was performed of 18 consecutive revision TAA cases between 2008-2015 using an intramedullary-referencing, fixed-bearing, 2-component total ankle system. Demographic and radiographic data were collected preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at the most recent follow-up. Functional outcome data were collected immediately postoperatively and at mean follow-up 47.5 months.
Eighteen patients underwent revision TAA, with 77.8% (14/18) implant survival. Index revision was performed most commonly for aseptic talar subsidence (55.6%) or implant loosening (tibia, 29.4%; talus, 58.9%). Following revision, 22.2% (4/18) patients required reoperation at a mean 57.3 (39-86) months.

Subsidence of the tibial and talar revision components was observed in 38.9% (7/18) and 55.6% (10/18) of patients, respectively. The median American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score was 74.5 (26-100) and Foot Function Index (FFI) score 10.2 (0-50.4).

Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine|The motion capture and force plates data are essential inputs for musculoskeletal multibody dynamics models to predict in vivo tibiotalar contact forces. However, it could be almost impossible to obtain valid force plates data in old patients undergoing total ankle arthroplasty under some circumstances, such as smaller gait strides and inconsistent walking speeds during gait analysis. To remove the dependence of force plates, this study has established a patient-specific musculoskeletal multibody dynamics model with total ankle arthroplasty by combining a foot-ground contact model based on elastic contact elements. And the established model could predict ground reaction forces, ground reaction moments and tibiotalar contact forces simultaneously. Three patients' motion capture and force plates data during their normal walking were used to establish the patient-specific musculoskeletal models and evaluate the predicted ground reaction forces and ground reaction moments. Reasonable accuracies were achieved for the predicted and measured ground reaction forces and ground reaction moments. The predicted tibiotalar contact forces for all patients using the foot-ground contact model had good consistency with those using force plates data. These findings suggested that the foot-ground contact model could take the place of the force plates data for predicting the tibiotalar contact forces in other total ankle arthroplasty patients, thus providing a simplified and valid platform for further study of the patient-specific prosthetic designs and clinical problems of total ankle arthroplasty in the absence of force plates data.|||||10.1177/0954411920947208|2020-08-04|"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yanwei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Zhenxian', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Key Laboratory of Road Construction Technology and Equipment (Ministry of Education), School of Mechanical Engineering, Chang'an University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Yinghu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Hongmou', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Foot and Ankle Surgery Department, Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Xiaojun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Foot and Ankle Surgery Department, Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Zhongmin', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.\nTribology Research Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China.\nInstitute of Medical and Biological Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.""}]"

While each technique guide offers granular instruction to ensure an accurate assessment of the distal tibia bone cut, it is not typically clear whether the Angel Wing should be placed medially or laterally with respect to the ankle and/or the X-ray beam. We found that placing the Angel Wing guide ipsilateral to the X-ray beam leads to added magnification of the guide with respect to the tibia. This magnification may result in a larger than intended resection of bone and subsequent placement of the implant in a more proximal position. A more proximal position of the distal tibial cutting guide leads to the implant interfacing with softer bone and an increased risk for implant subsidence. Given this risk and the possible effect of increased magnification on the extramedullary cutting guide, we strongly advise the surgeon to place the guide contralateral to the X-ray beam with respect to the tibia during total ankle arthroplasty.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The ACS NSQIP database was used to identify 1141 patients who underwent primary and revision TAA between 2007 and 2017. Propensity score matching was used to match patients based on several factors, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, and several comorbidities. The incidence of various 30-day complications was compared between the short and standard LOS groups to assess for any differences in short-term outcomes.
A total of 892 patients were included in the final propensity score-matched analysis, with 446 patients in each group. The short LOS group had a significantly lower rate of medical complications (0.2% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.006) and non-home discharge (1.3% vs. 12.1%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in operative complications (0.4% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.107), unplanned readmission (0.4% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.451), reoperation (0.2% vs. 0.4%, p > 0.999), return to the OR (0.2% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.374), or mortality (0.7% vs. 0.0%, p > 0.249) between the short and standard LOS groups.

The comparative outcomes between AA and TAA using modern techniques remain unclear. A systematic search to identify all relevant articles comparing AA with TAA was conducted through 3 online databases. The clinical outcomes were extracted for meta-analysis, including AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society) score, VAS (visual analog scale), AOS (Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale), gait analysis, ROM (range of motion), satisfaction, complication, and reoperation. Our meta-analysis shows no heterogeneity in any subgroup analyses. There were no significant differences in AOFAS total, pain, and alignment scores between the AA and TAA groups. The TAA group had significant improvement in AOFAS function score compared with the AA group. There was no significant difference in VAS and AOS total scores between the 2 groups. No significant differences in gait analysis were observed between the 2 groups. The TAA group had significant improvement in both ROM and change in ROM compared with the AA group. There was no significant difference in satisfaction rate between the 2 groups. The TAA group had significantly higher complication and reoperation rates compared with the AA group. Our meta-analysis provides updated evidence on clinical outcomes comparing AA with TAA using third-generation implants. The TAA group had better improvement in AOFAS function and ROM than the AA group. No significant differences in pain relief, gait analysis, or patient satisfaction were observed between the 2 groups.||||Copyright © 2019 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

We further investigated patients and operative factors associated with wound complications.
A series of 660 TAAs were collected. The median follow-up was 84 months (range, 12-204 months). Minor wound complications included discoloration, swelling, or clinical concern that merited bringing the patient back sooner for review. Major wound complications included plastic surgical consultation, debridement by the nurse specialist, negative pressure therapy, or reoperation. All major complications initially had a course of empirical oral antibiotics. Since 2011, higher-risk patients have had their TAA performed through an extensile anteromedial approach.
Fifty-six patients (8.5%) had wound healing issues (17 major [2.6%], 39 minor [5.9%]). All issues became evident <21 days postoperatively. Inflammatory arthritis, smoking, and coronary disease were patient factors associated with major wound complications. Four patients were treated with negative pressure therapy, 4 with debridement in the operating room, and 2 eventually converted to fusions. Fourteen patients (82%) who had major complications had an ancillary procedure to balance the TAA through a separate incision.

A retrospective review of 2 patient cohorts operated on by 2 surgeons was performed from 2010 to 2018. We compared a group of TAA patients that did not receive TXA vs a subsequent group that received TXA. Patients received 1g intravenous TXA before the tourniquet was inflated followed by another 1 g after release of the tourniquet. Intraoperative blood loss was recorded and preoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were compared to postoperative levels. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were compared between the 2 groups. A total of 119 patients were included in the study, of whom 55 received TXA. No significant difference existed between the 2 groups in gender, age, body mass index, or Charlson comorbidity index.
There was no difference in estimated blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin/hematocrit values or preoperative to postoperative change in hemoglobin/hematocrit values. Additionally, there was no difference in wound complications or overall complication rate between the groups.

In the present study, polyethylene inserts of TARs retrieved at revision surgery were analyzed for burnishing, scratching, mechanical damage, pitting, and embedded particles.
Fourteen retrieved polyethylene inserts from a fixed bearing total ankle replacement design currently in clinical use were analyzed. Duration of time in vivo was between 11.5 months and 120.1 months. Three investigators independently graded each articular surface in quadrants for five features of damage: burnishing, scratching, mechanical damage, pitting, and embedded particles.
No correlation was found for burnishing between the anterior and posterior aspects (p = 0.47); however, scratching and pitting were significantly higher on the posterior aspect compared to the anterior aspect (p < 0.03). There was a high correlation between burnishing and in vivo duration of the implant (anterior: R = 0.67, p = 0.01, posterior: R = 0.68, p = 0.01).

The primary aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the survivorship of total ankle replacement implants currently in use. An extensive search strategy initially captured 20,842 citations that were evaluated for relevance. Abstract screening produced 97 articles to be read in entirety, of which 10 articles studying 1963 implants met all prospective inclusion criteria for analysis. Overall survivorship of all implants was 93.0% (95% confidence interval, 85.2-96.9) using a random effect model. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (Q = 131.504). Meta-regression identified an inverse relationship between survivorship and study follow-up duration (p < .0001). Furthermore, age (p = .36) and implant type (fixed-bearing [95.6%, 95% confidence interval, 85.9-98.7] versus mobile-bearing ]89.4%, 95% confidence interval, 79.6%-94.8%]) did not have a statistically significant impact on survivorship, p = .213. However, patients with higher preoperative functional scores had improved survivorship (p = .001). Complications were inconsistently reported with varied definitions. In order of reported frequency, complications were classified into technical error (28.15%), subsidence (16.89%), implant failure (13.28%), aseptic loosening (6.3%), intraoperative fracture (5.67%), wound problems (4.3%), deep infection (1%), and postoperative fracture (0.0001%). Overall study quality was low, with only 10% being prospective and 90% from nonregistry data. The results from this meta-analysis revealed a promising overall survivorship of current implants in use for total ankle replacement; however higher quality studies with standardized outcomes measures are needed.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

112|32600132|Effect of age on outcome and revision in total ankle arthroplasty.|['Ankle osteoarthritis', 'Revision surgery', 'Total ankle arthroplasty']|The bone & joint journal|"To assess the effect of age on clinical outcome and revision rates in patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) for end-stage ankle osteoarthritis (OA).
A consecutive series of 811 ankles (789 patients) that underwent TAA between May 2003 and December 2013 were enrolled. The influence of age on clinical outcome, including the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score, and pain according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) was assessed. In addition, the risk for revision surgery that includes soft tissue procedures, periarticular arthrodeses/osteotomies, ankle joint debridement, and/or inlay exchange (defined as minor revision), as well as the risk for revision surgery necessitating the exchange of any of the metallic components or removal of implant followed by ankle/hindfoot fusion (defined as major revision) was calculated.
A significant improvement in the AOFAS hindfoot score and pain relief between the preoperative assessment and the last follow-up was evident. Age had a positive effect on pain relief. The risk for a minor or major revision was 28.7 % at the mean follow-up of 5.4 years and 11.0 % at a mean follow-up of 6.9 years respectively. The hazard of revision was not affected by age.
The clinical outcome, as well as the probability for revision surgery following TAA, is comparable between younger and older patients. The overall revision rate of the Hintegra total ankle is comparable with other three component designs. TAA should no longer be reserved for low demand elderly patients, but should also be recognized as a viable option for active patients of younger age.

The talar component subsidence may be a risk factor for revision surgery; however, there are no reports regarding talar component placement and subsidence amount following total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). We therefore investigated the relationship between talar component placement and subsidence amount.
Fifty-two ankles from 49 patients (age: 71 years [range 62-83], 13 male/ 36 female), who underwent TAA with mean follow-up of 36 months (range 12-83), were included. The subjects were divided into two groups based on talar component placement: anterior placement (n = 20, group A) and posterior placement (n = 32, group P) using weight-bearing lateral plain radiographs. The amount of the talar component subsidence and clinical outcomes, which included the Japanese Society for Surgery of the Foot (JSSF) scale, range of the motion (ROM) and the revision rate, were compared between the groups.
Talar component subsidence was significantly higher in group A (2.1 ± 2.0 mm) than in group P (0.6 ± 1.4 mm, P = .017). There was no significant difference in the JSSF scale and ROM between group A and group P. The revision rate was 10.0% in group A and 6.3% in group P, albeit not statistically significant.
Greater talar component subsidence was observed when the talar component was placed more anteriorly, suggesting that anterior placement of the talar component may need to be avoided during the surgery in order to minimize the postoperative talar component subsidence."|Greater talar component subsidence was observed when the talar component was placed more anteriorly, suggesting that anterior placement of the talar component may need to be avoided during the surgery in order to minimize the postoperative talar component subsidence.||Talar component subsidence was significantly higher in group A (2.1 ± 2.0 mm) than in group P (0.6 ± 1.4 mm, P = .017).

116|32574472|Does Coronal Plane Malalignment of the Tibial Insert in Total Ankle Arthroplasty Alter Distal Foot Bone Mechanics? A Cadaveric Gait Study.|[]|Clinical orthopaedics and related research|"Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is becoming a more prevalent treatment for end-stage ankle arthritis. However, the effects of malalignment on TAA remain poorly understood.
The purpose of this study was to quantify the mechanical effects of coronal plane malalignment of the tibial insert in TAA using cadaveric gait simulation. Specifically, we asked, is there a change in (1) ankle joint congruency, (2) kinematic joint position, (3) kinematic ROM, (4) peak plantar pressure, and (5) center of pressure with varus and valgus malalignment?
A modified TAA was implanted into seven cadaveric foot specimens. Wedges were used to simulate coronal plane malalignment of the tibial insert. The degree of malalignment (tibial insert angle [TIA] and talar component angle [TCA]) was quantified radiographically for neutral and 5°, 10°, and 15° varus and valgus wedges. Dynamic walking at 1/6 of physiological speed was simulated using a robotic gait simulator. A motion capture system was used to measure foot kinematics, and a pressure mat was used to measure plantar pressure. Joint congruency was quantified as the difference between TIA and TCA. Continuous joint position, joint ROM, peak plantar pressure, and center of pressure for varus and valgus malalignment compared with neutral alignment were estimated using linear mixed effects regression. Pairwise comparisons between malalignment conditions and neutral were considered significant if both the omnibus test for the overall association between outcome and malalignment and the individual pairwise comparison (adjusted for multiple comparisons within a given outcome) had p ≤ 0.05.
Descriptively, the TIA and TCA were both less pronounced than the wedge angle and component incongruence was seen (R = 0.65; p < 0.001). Varus malalignment of the tibial insert shifted the tibiotalar joint into varus and internally rotated the joint. The tibiotalar joint's ROM slightly increased as the TIA shifted into varus (1.3 ± 0.7° [mean ± SD] [95% confidence interval -0.7 to 3.4]; p = 0.03), and the first metatarsophalangeal joint's ROM decreased as the TIA shifted into varus (-1.9 ± 0.9° [95% CI -5.6 to 1.7]; p = 0.007). In the sagittal plane, the naviculocuneiform joint's ROM slightly decreased as the TIA shifted into varus (-0.9 ± 0.4° [95% CI -2.1 to 0.3]; p = 0.017). Hallux pressure increased as the TIA became more valgus (59 ± 50 kPa [95% CI -88 to 207]; p = 0.006). The peak plantar pressure slightly decreased in the third and fourth metatarsals as the TIA shifted into valgus (-15 ± 17° [95% CI -65 to 37]; p = 0.03 and -8 ± 4° [95% CI -17 to 1]; p = 0.048, respectively). The fifth metatarsal's pressure slightly decreased as the TIA shifted into valgus (-18 ± 12 kPa [95% CI -51 to 15]) or varus (-7 ± 18 kPa [95% CI -58 to 45]; p = 0.002). All comparisons were made to the neutral condition.
In this cadaver study, coronal plane malalignment in TAA altered foot kinematics and plantar pressure. In general, varus TAA malalignment led to varus shift and internal rotation of the tibiotalar joint, a slight increase in the tibiotalar ROM, and a slight decrease in the first metatarsophalangeal ROM, while a valgus TAA malalignment was manifested primarily through increased hallux pressure with a slight off-loading of the third and fourth metatarsals.
This study may increase our understanding of the biomechanical processes that underlie the unfavorable clinical outcomes (such as, poor patient-reported outcomes or implant loosening) that have been associated with coronal plane malalignment of the tibial component in TAA."|||Descriptively, the TIA and TCA were both less pronounced than the wedge angle and component incongruence was seen (R = 0.65; p < 0.001).

To investigate the influence of lipid extraction on the FTIR analysis of UHMWPE and to develop a novel method to obtain reliable results without inconvenient lipid extraction.
FTIR analysis was repeatedly performed on UHMWPE specimens from retrieved components before and after lipid extraction under various conditions. A method to calculate the extent of influence of the absorbed lipids from the FTIR spectra was developed using a peak separation technique.
An elevated temperature was necessary for lipid extraction; however, it had the potential to influence the results if the conditions were not properly controlled. The results obtained using the peak separation technique coincided with those obtained after lipid extraction.

119|32555074|Total ankle replacement in young patients.|[]|Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis|"High physical demand and younger age are currently considered contraindications for total ankle replacement. The number of Total Ankle Replacements (TAR) is widespread increasing and indications are expanding thanks to a steady improvement in prosthetic designs and better outcome. Commentary of the literature: in 1999 a study of 100 uncemented STAR™ (Waldemar-Link, Hamburg, Germany) prostheses showed a survival rate of 75% at 6.8 years in patients under 50 years old. Other studies (es, Barg et Al.) shows the risk of failure age-related in young patients compared to older group. A report of 780 TAR from the Swedish Ankle Register showed patients with primary or post-traumatic osteoarthritis under  60 years of age to have a 1.8 higher chance of revision compared to older patients. Discussion: ankle replacement has been traditionally reserved for patients older 50 years old and with low physical demand. Contrariwise this belief, TAR have already been used with a wide range of ages, sometimes even patients younger than 30 years old. Most of the ""negative"" score and results showed before are related to ""second-generation"" prosthetic designs, while recent studies used a ""third-generation"" prosthetic design. Conclusions: recent evidences showed better clinical results and higher satisfaction in people under the age of 50 compared to ankle arthrodesis with comparable rate of complications and survivorship. Younger people will have however a higher rate of reoperation but in the meantime, they will prevent progressive degeneration of adjacent joints."|||||10.23750/abm.v91i4-S.9725|2020-06-20|[{'lastname': 'Samaila', 'firstname': 'Elena Manuela', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Array. elenamanuela.samaila@univr.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Bissoli', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, University of Verona. elenamanuela.samaila@univr.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Argentini', 'firstname': 'Emanuele', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, University of Verona. elenamanuela.samaila@univr.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Negri', 'firstname': 'Stefano', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, University of Verona. elenamanuela.samaila@univr.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Colò', 'firstname': 'Gabriele', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Regional Center for Joint Arthroplasty, Alessandria. elenamanuela.samaila@univr.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Magnan', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, University of Verona. elenamanuela.samaila@univr.it.'}]

We reviewed the National Health Insurance data of Korea from 2007 to 2017. The data included diagnosis codes, procedure codes, prescriptions, medical costs, and other demographic data. Trends of primary diagnosis for primary TAA were evaluated. Annual trends and incidences per 100,000 person-years of primary TAA and revision procedures as well as compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the study period were analysed. Surgical trends according to patients' age, hospital grades, and insurance systems were also evaluated.
Primary diagnosis for primary TAA was mostly degenerative arthritis (6,501 cases; 90.5%). From 2007 to 2017, the total number of cases of primary TAA and revision procedures was 7,183 and 585, respectively. The number of cases in 2007 of primary TAA was 313; there were no cases of revision. The number of cases in 2017 of primary TAA were 986 and of revision were 108.

This systematic review summarizes the evidence on return to sports and activity after operative management with either TAR or AA for ankle osteoarthritis (OA).
A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria. Included studies reported sport and activity outcomes in patients undergoing TAR and AA, with primary outcomes being the percentage of sports participation and level of sports participation.
Twelve studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. There were 1270 ankle procedures, of which 923 TAR and 347 AA were performed. The mean reported patient age was 59.2 years and the mean BMI was 28 kg/m
Participation in sports activity was nearly 10% improved after operative management of ankle OA with TAR and remains high after AA. The existing literature demonstrated a large improvement in pre- to postoperative activity levels after TAR, with minimal change in activity after AA; however, AA patients were more active at baseline. The most frequent postoperative sports activities after operative management of ankle OA were swimming, hiking, cycling, and skiing. Participation in high-impact sports such as tennis, soccer, and running was consistently limited after surgery. This review of the literature will allow patients and foot and ankle surgeons to set evidence-based goals and establish realistic expectations for postoperative physical activity after TAR and AA.

The anterior and lateral approaches both have pros and cons regarding their respective soft tissue complications, osteotomy requirements, orientation of the bone cut, and gutter visualization. Although both have been studied independently, few reports have compared both in the same setting. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the difference in reoperation rate after lateral or anterior approach ankle arthroplasty. We hypothesized that the anterior approach had a higher rate of wound complications.
We evaluated data from a single center collected between 2014 and 2017, comprising a total of 115 total ankle replacements performed by 1 of 4 fellowship-trained foot and ankle surgeons. Reoperations were recorded as an operative report with classification by Canadian Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (COFAS) Reoperations Coding System (CROCS). The index approach used was determined by the surgeon's practice preference. Patients were included when they had a primary TAR in the time frame noted and had a complete data set up to at least 2 years after surgery. The cohort comprised 67 anterior and 48 lateral operations with balanced demographics for age (95% CI: 63-67 years) and gender (47% F). The lateral group had more complex cases with higher COFAS type arthritis (more periarticular arthritis and surrounding deformity).
Comparing the 2 groups, a total of 40 reoperations (7 anterior [A], 33 lateral [L]) occurred in 27 patients (5 A, 22 L). One patient had 4 related reoperations. The only revision was in the anterior group. The only soft tissue reconstruction was a split-thickness skin graft in the lateral group. Nine reoperations were irrigation debridement related to an infection or wound complication (3 A, 6 L). The majority (19/33) of reoperations in the lateral group were gutter debridement (8) or lateral hardware removal (11). Operative time was statistically different at 145 minutes (95% CI: 127-164 minutes) in anterior TAR and 178 minutes (95% CI: 154-202 minutes) for lateral TAR (
The results at the 2-year time point demonstrated that there were more reoperations after a lateral approach TAR than an anterior TAR, recognizing the significant case complexity imbalance between the groups and a corresponding relative increase in resource utilization of lateral TAR patients. The 2 implant designs were associated with different reoperation rates, favoring the anterior group. Change in the lateral fixation may have reduced the risk of repeat surgery.

In these special cases gait analysis reveals real motion at the replaced tibiotalar joint.
Twenty-three patients affected by ankle and subtalar arthritis, treated either with a 3-component or a 2-component prosthesis in combination with subtalar arthrodesis, were clinically evaluated preoperatively and at a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Gait analysis was performed postoperatively using a multi-segment foot protocol. Foot kinematics were compared to corresponding data from a healthy control group.
Clinical scores significantly improved from preoperative to follow-up. The clinically measured passive ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion significantly improved at the follow-up. Patients' normalized walking speed and stride length were significantly lower than those in control. With exception of the ankle frontal-plane motion, sagittal-plane mobility of foot joints was about 50% than that in healthy joints.
Improvement in clinical scores was found for both prostheses. Normal spatio-temporal parameters were not restored. In these patients, fusion of the subtalar joint appeared to be compensated by larger frontal-plane motion at the tibiotalar joint.

We aimed to study the 1-, 3-, and 5-year outcomes of TAR in comparison with TKR and THR.
PROMs data from patients who underwent a primary THR, TKR, or TAR performed between March 2008 and 2013 over a 5-year period were collected from our hospital patient registry. They were divided into 3 groups based on the type of primary joint replacement. Patient demographics and patient-reported outcomes (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC], 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) scores, and patient satisfaction scores at follow-up) were compared preoperatively and at the 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-ups.

The 2012-2016 American College of Surgeons - National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried using Current Procedural Terminology code 27702 for patients undergoing TAA. Discharge to a destination was categorized into home and non-home. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression models were used to evaluate independent risk factors associated with non-home discharge disposition. As a secondary objective, we also evaluated risk factors associated with a prolonged length of stay (LOS) >2 days. A total of 722 TAAs were retrieved for final analysis. A total of 68 (9.4%) patients experienced a non-home discharge following the surgery. Independent factors for a non-home discharge were a LOS >2 days (odds ratio [OR] 10.51), age ≥65 years (OR 4.52), female (OR 2.90), hypertension (OR 2.63), and American Society of Anesthesiologists >II (OR 2.01). A total of 174 (24.1%) patients stayed in the hospital for more than 2 days. Significant risk factors for LOS >2 days were age ≥65 years (OR 1.62), female (OR 1.53), operative time >150 minutes (OR 1.91), and an inpatient admission status (OR 4.74). With limited literature revolving around outcomes following TAA, the current study identifies significant predictors associated with a non-home discharge. Providers should consider preoperatively risk-stratifying and expediting discharge in these patients to reduce the costs associated with a prolonged hospital length of stay.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

We examined the survival rates of our primary TAAs, and what different factors, including the cause of arthritis, affect the success and/or revision rate.Patients and methods - From 2004 to 2016, 322 primary Hintegra TAAs were implanted: the 2nd generation implant from 2004 until mid-2007 and the 3rd generation from late 2007 to 2016. A Cox proportional hazards model evaluated sex, age, primary diagnosis, and implant generation, pre- and postoperative angles and implant position as risk factors for revision.Results - 60 implants (19%) were revised, the majority (n = 34) due to loosening. The 5-year survival rate (95% CI) was 75% (69-82) and the 10-year survival rate was 68% (60-77). There was a reduced risk of revision, per degree of increased postoperative medial distal tibial angle at 0.84 (0.72-0.98) and preoperative talus angle at 0.95 (0.90-1.00), indicating that varus ankles may have a larger revision rate. Generation of implant, sex, primary diagnosis, and most pre- and postoperative radiological angles did not statistically affect revision risk.Interpretation - Our revision rates are slightly above registry rates and well above those of the developer. Most were revised due to loosening; no difference was demonstrated with the 2 generations of implant used. Learning curve and a low threshold for revision could explain the high revision rate.|||||10.1080/17453674.2020.1751499|2020-04-15|[{'lastname': 'Zafar', 'firstname': 'Mina Jane', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hvidovre University Hospital, Denmark.\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Kallemose', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Orthopedic Research Centre, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Benyahia', 'firstname': 'Mostafa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hvidovre University Hospital, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Ebskov', 'firstname': 'Lars Bo', 'initials': 'LB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hvidovre University Hospital, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Penny', 'firstname': 'Jeannette Østergaard', 'initials': 'JØ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hvidovre University Hospital, Denmark.\nDepartment of Orthopedic Surgery.

Two effective ways to treat osteoarthritis of the ankle are total ankle replacement (TAR) and ankle arthrodesis (AAD). Whether TAR or AAD is more beneficial for treatment is controversial. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficiency (clinical outcome and patient satisfaction) and safety (complications and survival) of these two procedures. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was performed as a guideline for this study. Three electronic databases, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, were searched up to May 2019, with no language restrictions. Prospective or retrospective comparative studies were identified. The outcomes included clinical outcome, patient satisfaction, complications, and survival. Review Manager (Revman) 5.3 software was used to conduct the data analysis. We only selected literature from the past 5 years (no earlier than 2015). Seven comparative studies were included. There were six cohort studies and one cross-sectional study. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of cohort studies, and The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) checklist was chosen to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies. No significant difference was observed for efficiency and safety. Clinical outcome was included in five studies with four different scoring systems. Two of them used the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) questionnaire scores to assess the two procedures (mean difference, -4.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.37-2.85; P = 0.24; I||||© 2020 The Authors.

One recent innovation utilizes a transfibular, lateral approach. Like any new system, there is likely a learning curve associated with its use. We analyzed a series of patients who received a total ankle arthroplasty via a transfibular approach to state if it is possible to identify and to evaluate effects of a learning curve in the use of this novel total ankle replacement system.
76 consecutive patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had a minimum of 24 months of follow-up. Intraoperative parameters, preoperative and postoperative subjective outcome scores, radiographic parameters, and complications were recorded and evaluated.
There were significant learning curve effects on various surgical and postoperative parameters. Surgical time decreased with the curve stabilizing after the 16th patient. With regard to patient outcomes, a learning curve was identified for the VAS, AOFAS, and SF-12 MCS scores. The number of patients required to stabilize these curves were 21, 13, and 16, respectively. Alignment as measured by alpha and gamma angles also improved with experience, with the curves stabilizing at 18 and 15 patients, respectively. There was a larger number cases required for complication rates, with the curve stabilizing after the 39th patient. No significant learning curve was found for ankle ROM, SF-12 PCS, beta angle, tibio-talar ratio (TTR), or tibio-talar surface angle (TTS).
This study demonstrates a significant learning curve with respect to operative time, patient outcomes, and radiographic parameters. Extrapolating this information, we urge surgeons to adequately familiarize themselves with any new implant through a training program in a high-volume center.

Although dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the ""gold standard"" for evaluation of these issues, it is rarely used in patients after TAA. This study aimed to establish a scan technique and to assess the mechanical changes in bone density caused by bone stock preparation.
Eight fresh-frozen cadaver legs were investigated by DEXA before TAA, with implant in situ, and after implant removal. Scan surface, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density were analysed to assess mechanical bone mass changes.
We examined data for density changes by bone compression after TAA, and found ""good"" results for internal reliability but only ""acceptable"" results for external reliability.
The results were reliable and reproducible. Using the present data, mechanical and biological processes can be considered together to understand the postoperative phases of bone remodelling after TAA."|||"We examined data for density changes by bone compression after TAA, and found ""good"" results for internal reliability but only ""acceptable"" results for external reliability."|Copyright © 2020 European Foot and Ankle Society.

The mechanical axis of the lower limb (MAL), the mechanical axis of the tibia (MAT) and the anatomical axis of the tibia (AAT) are three well described coronal plane measurements using plain radiography. The assumption is that the MAL, MAT and AAT are equivalent. The relationship between these axes can vary in the presence of proximal deformity. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between MAL, MAT and AAT in a cohort of patients considered for TAR.
75 consecutive standardised preoperative long leg radiographs of patients with end stage ankle osteoarthritis, between 2016 and 2017 at a specialist tertiary center for elective orthopedic surgery were analysed. Patients were split into 2 groups. The first group had a clinically and radiologically detectable deformity proximal to the ankle (such as previous tibial or femoral fracture, severe arthritis, or previous reconstructive surgery), whereas the second (normal) group did not. The MAL, MAT and AAT were measured and the difference between these values were calculated.
There were 54 patients in the normal group, and 21 patients in the deformity group. The mean difference between the MAL and AAT was 1.7 ± 1.3° (range, 0.1-5.4°). In the normal group, 15 patients (27%) had a difference of >2° between the MAL and AAT, compared with 52% in the deformity group. The mean difference between the MAL and MAT was 0.9 ± 1.7° (range, -4 to -3.5°). In the deformity group, 42% of patients had a difference between MAT and MAL of >2°, compared with 20% in the normal group.

Our study adds to the current understanding of single-photon emission computed tomography combined with conventional computed tomography (SPECT-CT) as a diagnostic tool for painful TAR. We hypothesized that SPECT-CT would be predictive of clinical and intraoperative findings and would be more useful than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in our cohort.
A retrospective review of SPECT-CT imaging performed at our institution in patients with painful TAR from January 2014 to November 2018 was conducted. A total of 37 patients were identified, and 28 of them underwent revision surgery. Additionally, 19 patients had an MRI during the same time frame. Imaging results were compared to the documented clinical findings and intraoperative findings during revision surgery.
Of the 37 patients included, 89.2% (33/37) had SPECT-CT results that were consistent with the ultimate diagnosis documented in the medical record. Aseptic loosening (12/33) and impingement (11/33) were the most common diagnoses. Among patients who underwent revision surgery, SPECT-CT results were consistent with intraoperative findings in 26 of the 28 (92.9%) cases. In the 19 patients who also underwent MRI, the findings were consistent with clinical findings 36.8% (7/19) of the time.

144|32149932|A Systematic Review of Unsystematic Total Ankle Replacement Wear Evaluations.|[]|JBJS reviews|"Numerous studies have reported the use of laboratory multistation joint simulators to successfully predict wear performance and functionality of hip and knee replacements. In contrast, few studies in the peer-reviewed literature have used joint simulation to quantify the wear performance and functionality of ankle replacements. We performed a systematic review of the literature on joint simulator studies that quantified polyethylene wear in total ankle arthroplasty. In addition to the quantified wear results, the load and motion parameters were identified and compared among the studies.
A search was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to identify articles reporting total ankle replacement polyethylene wear using joint simulators.
Nine studies that used joint simulators and 1 study that used a computer simulation were found. Although all studies used physiological multidirectional motions (i.e., internal/external rotation, plantar flexion/dorsiflexion, anterior/posterior translation), there was large variability among the studies in the magnitudes of these motions. Among these studies, mean non-cross-linked polyethylene wear ranged from 3.3 ± 0.4 to 25.8 ± 3.1 mm per million cycles. In contrast, mean highly cross-linked polyethylene wear ranged from 2.1 ± 0.3 to 3.3 ± 0.4 mm per million cycles. The wide distribution in wear rates was attributable to the highly inconsistent kinematic parameters and loads applied as well as differences in implant design and materials.
There is a severe lack of clinically applicable data on wear performance of total ankle replacements in the peer-reviewed literature. No universal set of kinematic load parameters has been established. Furthermore, only 2 of the published studies have validated their findings using independently derived data, such as retrieval analysis. These shortcomings make it difficult to compare findings as a function of design parameters and materials, or to draw clinically relevant conclusions from these simulations. More work is required to enhance the predictive capability of in vitro simulations of total ankle replacements.
The results of joint wear simulator studies may not accurately represent in vivo wear of total ankle replacements. Joint simulator studies should establish that they are accurately replicating in vivo wear, thus enabling use of their predictive capabilities for new materials and designs."|||Nine studies that used joint simulators and 1 study that used a computer simulation were found.

A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who had a concomitant tibia, fibula, or combined tibia and fibula osteotomy at the same time as TAR. Routine radiographs were used to assess osteotomy union rates and changes in alignment. Outcomes questionnaires were evaluated preoperatively and at most recent follow-up.

The optimum treatment for ankle PJI is not well established. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the clinical effectiveness of various treatment strategies for infected ankle prostheses. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018 for studies evaluating the impact of treatment in patient populations with infected ankle prostheses following TAR. Binary data were pooled after arcsine transformation. Six citations comprising 17 observational design comparisons were included. The reinfection rates (95% confidence intervals) for DAIR with or without polyethylene exchange, 1-stage revision, 2-stage revision, cement spacer, and arthrodesis were 39.8% (24.4 to 56.1), 0.0% (0.0 to 78.7), 0.0% (0.0 to 8.5), 0.2% (0.0 to 17.9), and 13.6% (0.0 to 45.8), respectively. Rates of amputation for DAIR with or without polyethylene exchange and cement spacer were 5.6% (0.0 to 16.9) and 22.2% (6.3 to 54.7), respectively. Measures of function, pain, and satisfaction could not be compared because of limited data. One- and 2-stage revision strategies seem to be associated with the lowest reinfection rates, but these findings are based on limited data. Arthrodesis and DAIR with or without polyethylene exchange appear to be commonly used in treating infected ankle prosthesis, but are associated with poor infection control. Clear gaps exist in the literature, and further research is warranted to evaluate treatment strategies for infected ankle prosthesis.||||Copyright © 2019 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

We collected knowledge and perceptions on both procedures to determine the need for a patient decision aid for these patients by administering a cross-sectional survey to 103 orthopaedic surgeons. Respondents were predominantly male and 41 to 50 years old. Half of those who stated that they do not perform arthroplasty said this was because they do not have adequate training. Additionally, certain variables were associated with the surgeon's choice of intervention: patient gender, age, body mass index, postoperative activity level, employment type, perceived risk of infection, neurovascular injury or wound complication, risk of developing or pre-existing adjacent arthritis, deformity, malalignment, bone loss or abnormal bone quality, number of prior ankle operations, cause of arthritis, and desire for motion preservation. The majority agreed that they always incorporate patient preferences into their decisions and that a decision aid would be beneficial. This survey revealed that several patient characteristics are influential in the surgeon's preference for either arthroplasty or arthrodesis for end-stage ankle arthritis. Because the majority of surgeons incorporate patient preferences in their decisions and report that a decision aid would be beneficial for informed decision-making in this clinical scenario, this survey identified an unmet need supporting the development of such a tool for these patients.||||Copyright © 2019 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The American Board of Orthopedic Surgery Part II database was queried to identify all candidates who performed ≥1 TAA or AAD from examination years 2009 through 2018. Candidates were categorized by examination year and by self-reported fellowship training status. Descriptive statistical methods were used to report procedure volumes. Trends in use of TAA and AAD were examined by using log-modified regression analyses. From 2009through 2018, there was no significant change in TAA or AAD use among all candidates (p = .92, p = .20). Candidates reporting a foot and ankle fellowship trended toward increased use of TAA relative to AAD compared with non-foot and ankle fellowship candidates, but this failed to reach statistical significance (p = .06). The use of arthroscopic AAD increased over time (p < .01) among all candidates. TAA and AAD use did not change over the study period. Volume of TAA and AAD performed by early-career surgeons remains low.

With nearly 80% of end-stage ankle arthritis being secondary to prior trauma, patients may require a replacement at a much younger rate than primary hip and knee arthritis. Historical accounts of implant failure and high revision rates in younger patients have been reported in the literature. With increasing technology and surgeon experience, implants are being used in younger patients with significantly fewer complications than early reports. In this retrospective review, we evaluated the patient-reported outcome measures and implant complications in three age subsets in arthroplasty patients; Group 1: <55 years-old, Group 2: 55-70 years-old, and Group 3: >70 years-old. In our study, mean postoperative American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scores were 75.5 for group 1, 79.7 for group 2, and 86.9 for group 3, which improved from preoperative scores of 50, 52.4, and 53.8, respectively. Mean postoperative Foot Function Index (FFI) scores were 10 for group 1, 23.9 for group 2, and 12.3 for group 3, which improved from 59.4, 62.8, and 47.6 preoperatively, respectively. The overall complication rate was found to be 11.2%. The complication rate for group 1 was 18%, the complication rate for group 2 was 11.6%, and the complication rate was 9.4% for group 3. The differences in patient AOFAS hindfoot, FFI scores, and complication rates between the groups were not found to be statistically significant. Our results show that patients younger than age 55 years have similar complication rates and reported satisfaction scores to patients 55 years of age and older.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

This article describes the statistical analysis plan for this trial as an update to the published protocol. It is written prior to the end of patient follow-up, while the outcome of the trial is still unknown.
TARVA is a randomised, un-blinded, parallel group trial of total ankle replacement versus ankle arthrodesis. The primary outcome is the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire walking/standing domain score at 52 weeks post-surgery. Secondary outcomes include measures of pain, social interaction, physical function, quality of life, and range of motion. We describe in detail the statistical aspects of TARVA: the outcome measures, the sample size calculation, general analysis principles including treatment of missing data, the planned descriptive statistics and statistical models, and planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
The TARVA statistical analysis will provide comprehensive and precise information on the relative effectiveness of the two treatments. The plan will be implemented in January 2020 when follow-up for the trial is completed.

Several published studies have demonstrated that takedown of a painful ankle arthrodesis to total ankle arthroplasty can assist in restoring some sagittal plane motion and improving functional scores. The goal of this study was to contribute to the limited body of literature with the largest cohort and longest follow-up to date. A retrospective analysis was performed on patient and surgical characteristics of those who underwent a conversion of a painful ankle arthrodesis to a total ankle arthroplasty by 1 of 3 experienced total ankle arthroplasty surgeons from February 2003 to December 2016 with ≥2 years of follow up. Seventy-seven subjects were included for evaluation, with an implant retention rate of 88% (68 of 77) and mean follow-up of 8.3 years (range 2.6 to 15.8). Of the 11 (14%) failures (defined as retrieval or exchange of metallic components), 8 (10%) were revised to a total ankle replacement, 2 (2%) underwent revision arthrodesis, and 1 (1%) elected for below-the-knee amputation. The mean time since the primary arthrodesis was 8.6 years (range 1 to 44), and the longer time interval between primary arthrodesis to takedown total ankle arthroplasty did not correlate with poorer outcome scores or increased risk of failure. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot, Buechel-Pappas, and visual analog pain scale scores improved from preoperative values, with less satisfaction noted in those who needed revision surgery. The conversion of a painful ankle arthrodesis to a total ankle implant is a viable option to obtain range of motion and improved patient satisfaction scores similar to primary total ankle replacement.||||Copyright © 2020 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Electronic databases were searched up until May 2019. Peer-reviewed journal studies including adult participants suffering from end-stage ankle osteoarthritis and reporting pre- and post-operative kinematics, kinetics and spatio-temporal effects of total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis during walking were included with a minimum of 12 months follow-up. Seventeen suitable studies were identified and assessed according to methodological and biomechanical qualities. Meta-analysis was performed by calculating the effect size using standard mean differences between pre- and post-operative gait status.
Seventeen studies with a total of 883 patients were included. Meta-analysis revealed moderate evidence of an improvement in lower limb kinematics, kinetics and spatio-temporal parameters after total ankle replacement. Moderate evidence indicated an increase in ankle moment, hip range of motion and walking speed after ankle arthrodesis.
The currently available evidence base of research papers evaluating changes in gait biomechanics after total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis is limited by a lack of prospective research, low sample sizes and heterogeneity in the patho-etiology of ankle osteoarthritis. Following total ankle replacement, improvements were demonstrated for spatio-temporal, kinematic and kinetic gait patterns compared to the pre-operative measures. Improvements in gait mechanics after ankle arthrodesis were limited to walking speed and ankle moment. Increased hip range of motion after ankle arthrodesis could represent a sign of compensation for the lack of ankle motion."||||Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Soft tissue breakdown along the anterior incision can cause exposure of anterior tendons and implant, and adhesions of the extensor tendons of the foot. Recent publications have advocated for the implantation of dehydrated human amniotic membrane (DHAM) allograft during closure of anterior ankle incisions during TAA. The goal of this study was to determine whether implantation of DHAM allograft in TAAs decreased overall postoperative wound complications.
One hundred seventy patients with end-stage ankle arthritis refractory to conservative management underwent TAA with a standard anterior approach by 1 of 3 board-certified foot and ankle orthopedic surgeons. Ninety-one patients underwent closure of the anterior incision with addition of DHAM, whereas 79 patients served as the control (no addition of DHAM). The primary endpoints considered were postoperative complications and reoperation. Included in the postoperative complications was return to the operating room, postoperative plastic surgery intervention, wound communication with the implant, removal of the implant, neurolysis, tendon debridement, and extensor hallucis longus contracture/adhesions.
In the analysis of our demographically homogenous cohorts, there was no statistically significant difference in any postoperative complications between patients closed with DHAM and controls. Return to the operating room occurred in 8.9% of controls and 15.4% of the DHAM group (
The application of DHAM theoretically acts to decrease overall wound complications in TAA. The use of DHAM preceding wound closure in TAA did not show a statistically significant reduction in overall wound complications in our retrospective analysis. Further study, including prospective randomized studies, is needed to further investigate the effectiveness of DHAM in reducing wound complications in TAAs.

However, little is known about differences of the axial talar rotation between patients following mobile-bearing TAA. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the relative axial rotation between the talar and tibial component intraoperatively and after a minimum follow-up of 3 years following mobile-bearing TAA.
The relative axial rotation between the talar and the tibial component was measured intraoperatively in a cohort of 58 patients who underwent mobile-bearing TAA. In addition, it was measured on weightbearing computed tomography (CT) scans in 48 patients after a mean of 6.3 (3.0-16.3) years following mobile-bearing TAA. The pre- and postoperative alignment of the ankle joint/tibial component and hindfoot assessed on conventional radiographs was correlated with the intra- and postoperatively determined relative axial rotation of the talar and tibial component.
The mean intra- and postoperative axial talar component position was 1.7 (range, 14 internal to 14 external) and 1.4 (range, 12 internal to 20 external) degrees toward internal when compared to the tibial component (
The wide range of the relative axial rotation between the tibial and talar component suggests that it is crucial to allow the talus to intraoperatively find a position that corresponds to the patient's individual anatomy. The fact that the range of axial rotation was similar after a minimum of 3 years measured under weightbearing conditions suggests that structural changes of the osteoarthritic ankle may be the main determining factors for the axial rotational position of the talus. Our findings improve current understanding of proper implant position during TAA. In addition, the current study provides a reliable method to assess the postoperative axial position of the prosthesis components. The high interindividual variability of the relative rotation between the tibial and talar component in the axial plane suggests that axial malpositioning following TAA may be a more common issue than currently expected. Our findings may help to improve the assessment of patients with persistent pain following TAA.

However, conflicting results have been reported in the literature. The present study documents the incidence of heterotopic ossification for a novel fourth-generation fixed-bearing 2-component prosthesis and reports a systematic review of the literature. We reviewed the incidence and functional outcome of consecutively enrolled patients who underwent primary Infinity TAA between 2013 and 2015 in a prospective observational study. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic and functional outcome data were collected. A systematic review was also conducted investigating all published studies between 1998 and 2018 reporting the incidence of heterotopic ossification after TAA. The incidence of heterotopic ossification was 70.5% in the 61 patients who underwent primary TAA in the case series. There was no association between heterotopic ossification and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, foot function index (FFI), visual analogue scale (VAS), and ankle osteoarthritis scale (AOS). Sixteen studies on 1339 TAA implants were included. The overall incidence of heterotopic ossification after TAA was 66.0% at average 3.6 years (range 22.2% to 100%). Four studies (299 ankles) did not address functional outcomes. Eleven studies (960 ankles) reported no association between heterotopic ossification and functional outcomes. One study (80 ankles) reported a statistically significant difference in range of motion (7°) and AOFAS score (7 points). In conclusion, although the incidence of heterotopic ossification after TAA is considerable, there is insufficient literature to suggest that heterotopic ossification after TAA impacts range of motion or functional outcome.||||Copyright © 2020.

One of the fundamental reasons is due to the lack of primary stability of the prosthesis fixation at the bone-prosthesis interface hence leading to long-term aseptic loosening of the talar component. The commercially available Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) Ankle design and several additional design features (including trabecular metal, side fin, double fin, and polka-dot designs) were studied using finite element analysis, and the bone-prosthesis interface relative micromotion (BPIRM) and talar bone minimum principal stresses were examined and analysed. Three loading conditions at a gait cycle of heel strike, midstance, and toe off with different meniscal bearing displacement were also included as part of the study parameters. The results were correlated to in vitro cadaveric measurements and reported clinical studies. Simulated results showed that the de-bonding relative distance between the bone and prosthesis upon loading (COPEN defined by the simulation software) was the main reason constituting to the high interface micromotion between the talar component and talus bone (which could lead to long-term aseptic loosening). The polka-dot design was shown to induce the lowest BPIRM among all the designs studied.||||© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|10.1002/cnm.3310|2020-01-17|[{'lastname': 'Moideen', 'firstname': 'Irwan S M', 'initials': 'ISM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Chin Tat', 'initials': 'CT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National University Hospital, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Yeow', 'firstname': 'Raye C H', 'initials': 'RCH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Chong', 'firstname': 'Desmond Y R', 'initials': 'DYR', 'affiliation': 'Engineering Cluster, Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore.'}]
159|31928101|Better implant survival with modern ankle prosthetic designs: 1,226 total ankle prostheses followed for up to 20 years in the Swedish Ankle Registry.|[]|Acta orthopaedica|Background and purpose - We have previously reported on the prosthetic survival of total ankle replacements (TAR) in Sweden performed between 1993 and 2010. Few other reports have been published on 5- and 10-year survival rates. Furthermore, there is a lack of long-term outcome data on modern prosthetic designs. Therefore, we compared early and current prosthetic designs after a mean 7-year follow-up.Patients and methods - On December 31, 2016, 1,230 primary TARs had been reported to the Swedish Ankle Registry. We analyzed prosthetic survival, using exchange or permanent extraction of components as endpoint for 1,226 protheses with mean follow-up of 7 years (0-24). Differences between current (Hintegra, Mobility, CCI, Rebalance, and TM Ankle) and early prosthetic designs (STAR, BP, and AES) were examined by log rank test.Results - 267/1,226 prostheses (22%) had been revised by December 31, 2016. We found an overall prosthetic survival rate at 5 years of 0.85 (95% CI 0.83-0.87), at 10 years 0.74 (CI 0.70-0.77), at 15 years 0.63 (CI 0.58-0.67), and at 20 years 0.58 (CI 0.52-0.65). For early prosthetic designs the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 0.81 (CI 0.78-0.84) and 0.69 (CI 0.64-0.73) respectively, while the corresponding rates for current designs were 0.88 (CI 0.85-0.91) and 0.84 (CI 0.79-0.88). Current prosthetic designs had better survival (log rank test p < 0.001).Interpretation - Our results point to a positive time trend of prosthetic survival in Sweden; use of current prosthetic designs was associated with better prosthetic survival. Improved designs and instrumentation, more experienced surgeons, and improved patient selection may all have contributed to the better outcome.|||||10.1080/17453674.2019.1709312|2020-01-14|[{'lastname': 'Undén', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö.\nDepartment of Clinical Sciences Malmo (IKVM), Lund University.'}, {'lastname': 'Jehpsson', 'firstname': 'Lars', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences Malmo (IKVM), Lund University.\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamrad', 'firstname': 'Ilka', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences Malmo (IKVM), Lund University.\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö.'}, {'lastname': 'Carlsson', 'firstname': 'Åke', 'initials': 'Å', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences Malmo (IKVM), Lund University.\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö.'}, {'lastname': 'Henricson', 'firstname': 'Anders', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics, Falu Central Hospital and Center of Clinical Research Dalarna, Falun, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Karlsson', 'firstname': 'Magnus K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences Malmo (IKVM), Lund University.\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosengren', 'firstname': 'Björn E', 'initials': 'BE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences Malmo (IKVM), Lund University.\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö.'}]

Up to 33% to 44% of patients who present for total ankle replacement (TAR) have greater than 10° of coronal plane deformity. Normalization of the sagittal and coronal alignment is key in improving survivorship and functional outcomes in TAR. In the present study, we analyzed how both the ankle and hindfoot alignment for both a fixed-bearing and mobile-bearing TAR system changed over time. Specifically, we measured coronal and sagittal alignment of both the ankle and hindfoot complex.
A retrospective study was performed on 2 independent groups of patients undergoing 2 different systems for total ankle replacement: Zimmer (lateral approach, fixed-bearing) and Hintegra (anterior approach, mobile bearing). Specific demographic data and radiographic data were measured. Within-group comparisons were performed using 1-way repeated measures ANOVA, analyzing the temporal course of clinical data within the Hintegra and Zimmer groups.

However, no study has investigated this relationship in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). This study aimed to study the relationship between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes after TAA. This retrospective comparative study investigated 40 patients who underwent TAA for end-stage ankle arthritis. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Preoperative and postoperative clinical outcomes were compared using the visual analog scale (VAS) and American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores by classifying the subjects into depressive and nondepressive groups. The mean follow-up duration was 24.3 ± 7.3 (range 14 to 37) months. There were 13 and 27 subjects in the depressive and nondepressive groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics and preoperative VAS and AOFAS scores between them. The postoperative VAS score was significantly higher in the depressive group (3.1 ± 2.4) than in the nondepressive group (1.4 ± 2.3; p < .001). The postoperative AOFAS scores in the depressive and nondepressive groups were 89.3 ± 13.4 and 95.0 ± 8.1, respectively, showing a significantly superior result in the latter group (p < .001). The clinical outcomes after TAA were poorer in the patients with depressive symptoms than in those without. Depressive symptoms are patient-specific factors or independent predictors that show less improvement after TAA. Therefore, clinical considerations of these symptoms are essential before TAA.||||Copyright © 2019 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Contact mechanics for metal-polyethylene articulation in TAA is critical due to the reduced size of the implant and higher expected load, compared with a hip or knee joint. This study was focused on developing a validated computational model to predict contact area in a polyethylene tibial bearing articulating with a metallic talar component in a bicondylar TAA design. Contact area was evaluated at five different flexion angles in an experimental test and in a computational model, per ASTM F2665. The overall contact area values predicted in the computational model matched closely (within 8%) with that measured in the comparator; well within the range reported in the literature. The credibility of the model to sufficiently predict the outputs relative to the experimental data was discussed using the guidelines provided by the recently published ASME V&V 40-2018 standard. Various sensitivities associated with both the model and the comparator, were explored. It was concluded that the validated modeling approach presented in this study demonstrated sufficient accuracy to support the use of modeling for evaluation of contact area of TAA designs. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

American volume|"One disadvantage of lateral transfibular total ankle arthroplasty is the rate of symptoms related to the implant and wound issues requiring implant removal in association with the traditional fibular osteotomy. In the present study, lateral total ankle arthroplasty involving the traditional short oblique fibular osteotomy was compared with arthroplasty involving a long oblique osteotomy (the Foot & Ankle Reconstruction Group osteotomy).
We retrospectively reviewed all primary lateral total ankle arthroplasties that had been performed by a single surgeon from May 2013 to October 2016 and had a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. Clinical assessment included patient demographics, wound complications, the need for implant removal, the pain score on a visual analog scale, the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score, and the Short Form-12 Mental and Physical Component Summary scores. Weight-bearing radiographs were used to assess tibiotalar alignment, implant alignment, and fibular osteotomy healing.
One hundred and fifty-nine total ankle arthroplasties were identified. The traditional short fibular osteotomy was used in 50 ankles, and the long oblique osteotomy was used in 109. The rate of survival of the tibial and talar components of the ankle replacements was 100%, and there were no osteotomy nonunions. There was improvement in all clinical parameters, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. Radiographs showed excellent arthroplasty alignment at all time points, with no significant difference between the groups. There was a significant difference in the rates of wound dehiscence (p = 0.011) and fibular implant removal (p < 0.0001), with the long oblique osteotomy having lower rates of both (2.8% and 2.8%, respectively) compared with the short oblique osteotomy (14% and 28%, respectively).
In total ankle arthroplasty, modification of the traditional short oblique fibular osteotomy to a long oblique configuration provided excellent 2-year survival rates with good clinical and radiographic outcomes and decreased rates of wound complications and symptoms related to the fibular implant.

Complications can include graft failure, delamination of the graft, arthrofibrosis, advancing osteoarthritis, nonunion of malleolar osteotomies, and partial or complete osteonecrosis of the talus. Graft failure refers to failure of graft incorporation with subsequent necrosis and subsidence. Treatment options for talar graft failure are limited, and outcomes for these treatments have rarely been reported. We present a review of the published data on the complications and treatments for failed talar allograft transplantation. A case report is presented on a young woman who experienced graft failure and osteonecrosis of her talar allograft transplant. Because of the size of the present osteonecrosis, an ankle arthrodesis was performed as the initial revision procedure. Talar necrosis was removed and revascularized from the ankle fusion with solid fusion was confirmed with computed tomography. Symptomatic adjacent joint pain quickly developed in the hindfoot after the ankle fusion, and 12 months later an ankle fusion conversion to total ankle arthroplasty was performed. The patient has returned to normal activity with significant reduction in pain at most recent follow-up visit. This patient was followed for 7 years from initial osteochondral talar allograft transplantation and for 2 years from conversion of ankle fusion to total ankle arthroplasty. It is important to understand the techniques, indications, and outcomes for the various revision options for talar allograft failure. This case report illustrates how multiple revision options can be used to provide the best outcome for the patient.||||Copyright © 2019 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine|In vivo load and motion in the ankle joint play a key role in the understanding of the failure mechanism and function outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty. However, a thorough understanding of the biomechanics of the ankle joint in daily activities is lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a novel lower extremity musculoskeletal multibody dynamics model with total ankle arthroplasty considering the 6 degrees of freedom of the ankle joint motions and the deformable contact mechanics of the implant, based on force-dependent kinematics method. A patient who underwent total ankle arthroplasty surgery was considered. The walking gait data of the patient was measured in a gait laboratory and used as the input for the patient-specific musculoskeletal modeling. The predictions from the musculoskeletal model of total ankle arthroplasty included dorsiflexion-plantar flexion, inversion-eversion, internal-external rotation, anterior-posterior translation, inferior-superior translation, and medial-lateral translation of the tibiotalar joint, the ankle contact forces, the muscle activations, and the ligament forces. The magnitudes and tendencies of the predicted results were all within reasonable ranges, as compared with the data available in the literature. The predicted peak total ankle contact force was 6.55 body weight. In addition, the peak contact forces of the lateral and medial compartments were 4.22 body weight and 2.59 body weight, respectively. This study provides a potential new platform for the design of a better ankle prosthesis, the improvement of the operation techniques of the clinicians, and the accelerated postoperative recovery of the patients.|||||10.1177/0954411919890724|2019-11-23|"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yanwei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Zhenxian', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Key Laboratory of Road Construction Technology and Equipment (Ministry of Education), School of Mechanical Engineering, Chang'an University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Hongmou', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Foot and Ankle Surgery Department, Honghui Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Xiaojun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Foot and Ankle Surgery Department, Honghui Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Cheng', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Foot and Ankle Surgery Department, Honghui Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.\nXi'an Medical University, Xi'an, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Zhongmin', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing System Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.\nTribology Research Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China.\nInstitute of Medical and Biological Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.""}]"

Using the US National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, we assessed the association of age, race/ethnicity, comorbidity ,and insurance payer status, with healthcare utilization and in-hospital complications (infection, transfusion, and revision surgery) after TAA. We calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
The cohort consisted of 6280 TAAs with a mean age of 62 years; 52% were female, 70% White, and 62% had osteoarthritis as the underlying diagnosis. Compared to age < 50 years, older age categories had higher ORs of total hospital charges above the median, length of hospital stay above the median (>2 days) and discharge to a rehabilitation facility, 1.26-19.41, and a lower OR of in-hospital infection, 0.07-0.09. Compared to Whites, Blacks had higher OR (95% CI) of: discharge to a rehabilitation facility, 1.45 (1.06, 1.98); length of hospital stay >2 days, 2.21 (1.37, 3.57); in-hospital transfusion, 4.39 (1.87, 10.30); and in-hospital revision, 8.25 (1.06, 64.21); and Hispanics were more likely to have total hospital charges above the median, OR 1.49 (1.10, 2.02), and infection, 9.30 (1.27, 68.05). Higher comorbidity and Medicare payer status were each associated with higher ORs of healthcare utilization, ORs ranging 1.20-2.57 and 1.74-2.19, respectively.
Age, race/ethnicity, comorbidity, and insurance payer status were independently associated with post-TAA outcomes. Further insight into modifiable mediators of these associations can pave the way for improving these outcomes in the future.Key Points• Older age was associated with higher healthcare utilization post-ankle arthroplasty.• Compared to Whites, Blacks or Hispanics had higher healthcare utilization and in-hospital complications post-ankle arthroplasty.• Higher comorbidity and Medicare payer status were each associated with higher healthcare utilization post-ankle arthroplasty."|||The cohort consisted of 6280 TAAs with a mean age of 62 years; 52% were female, 70% White, and 62% had osteoarthritis as the underlying diagnosis.

The primary aim of this systematic review was to analyze the influence of preoperative tibiotalar varus and valgus alignment on the survival of TAR.
The databases MEDLINE and Embase were searched from onset through September 2018. Two authors performed study selection and data extraction using a predefined data extraction tool. Implant survival in the alignment groups was reported as ""revisions per 100 component years."" Additional procedures, complications, and revisions were also reported. Assessment of the methodological quality was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).
In total, 17 studies were considered eligible, in which a total of 1692 TARs were included from 1627 patients. The weighted mean follow-up was 52.4 (range, 1-147) months. The neutral alignment group included 711 TARs, the varus group included 545 TARs, and the valgus group included 332 TARs. Total revisions were 52, 37, and 36 in the preoperative tibiotalar neutral, varus, and valgus alignment groups, respectively. Revisions per 100 observed component years were 1.6, 1.7, and 2.5 in the preoperative tibiotalar neutral, varus, and valgus alignment groups, respectively. A total of 129 complications and 447 additional procedures were reported in 601 TARs.
There was a strong indication that preoperative varus alignment in the coronal plane had a comparable implant survival to neutral alignment. Preoperative valgus alignment demonstrated a more negative influence on implant survival.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of this implant among a prospective cohort of patients who underwent total ankle replacement for various etiologies. Forty-six patients (50 ankles) were consecutively enrolled in the study. Our primary aim was to assess implant survivorship as determined by the removal or revision of the implant metal components or conversion to arthrodesis. Our secondary aim was to gauge patient outcomes by using commonly used outcome scores and assess ankle range of motion using goniometric and radiographic methods. We report 100% survivorship of the implant at a mean follow-up of 4.9 years. Compared with preoperative levels, all clinical outcome scores showed significant improvement at the 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year and longer follow-up. The mean clinical ROM improved from 27.7° ± 10.7° preoperatively to 40.0° ± 12.3° at the 2-year follow-up (p < .001). The mean radiographic ROM improved from 23.0° ± 10.2° preoperatively to 27.2° ± 9.1° at the 2-year follow-up (p = .007). Reoperations or secondary procedures were performed on 6 (12%) ankles, with the most common procedure being gutter debridement for impingement symptoms. The study confirms that the excellent survivorship seen with the implant in the early studies extends to mid-term follow-up as well. Patients could expect to see improvement in pain relief and activity well into 5 years after surgery and retain sufficient ankle range of motion for normal gait.||||Copyright © 2019 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of synovial α-defensin levels in identifying PJI of the ankle. Data from 33 patients were retrospectively collected between September 2015 and May 2018. Patients who had pain or suspected loosening after TAA and who had undergone joint aspiration were included in the study. Aspiration was performed in a semisterile theatre. Synovial fluid was processed in descending order for microbiological cultures, α-defensin, leukocyte esterase strip test, and cell count. A periprosthetic infection was defined by Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy were calculated, and based on a receiver operating characteristic curve, the quality of the α-defensin test was determined. The calculated area under the curve was 0.97 ± 0.32. Two of 33 patients fulfilled the 2014 Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria and were scheduled for septic revision arthroplasty. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the α-defensin test were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.8% to 100%), 93.5% (95% CI, 78.6% to 99.2%), and 93.9% (95% CI, 79.8% to 99.3%), respectively. The positive predictive value was 50% (95% CI, 20.7% to 79.3%), and the negative predictive value was 100%. The α-defensin test seems to be the best available synovial test to detect a late-onset PJI after total ankle arthroplasty.

American volume|"A preoperative severe coronal plane deformity of >20° has been considered a contraindication for total ankle arthroplasty. We aimed to evaluate whether outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty in ankles with severe coronal plane deformity (20° to 35° of varus or valgus) are comparable with those with moderate deformity (5° to 15° of varus or valgus).
A total of 148 consecutive ankles (142 patients) that underwent primary total ankle arthroplasty using the HINTEGRA prosthesis were included. The overall mean follow-up duration was 74 months (range, 24 to 160 months). We divided all patients into 2 groups according to the preoperative coronal plane tibiotalar angle: the severe group (36 patients, 41 ankles) and the moderate group (106 patients, 107 ankles). Clinical and radiographic outcomes were analyzed for intergroup differences, and multivariable regression was used to adjust for baseline characteristics. Patients in each group showed similar characteristics in mean age, sex, mean body mass index, and median follow-up duration.
At a mean follow-up of 74 months, we found no significant intergroup difference in the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale pain and disability score, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score, Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary score, visual analog scale pain score, or ankle range of motion (p > 0.05). However, the final tibiotalar angle, talar tilt angle, and number of outliers were greater in the severe group (p < 0.05). Complication rates did not show a significant difference between the 2 groups (p > 0.05). The overall survival probability of the implant was 91.3% (92.3% in the severe group and 90.7% in the moderate group) (p = 0.354).
Total ankle arthroplasty in ankles with preoperative severe coronal plane deformity showed satisfactory and comparable clinical outcomes without increasing complication rates relative to those with moderate deformity in the intermediate-term follow-up.

American volume|"Malaligned ankle arthroplasty components have been associated with increased postoperative pain and reduced ankle range of motion. With this study, we aimed to quantify how anterior and posterior malalignment of the talar component affects foot bone kinematics and plantar pressures in a dynamic, cadaveric gait simulation.
Ten cadaveric foot specimens received a modified ankle prosthesis. Proper alignment was defined as the prosthesis being neutral to a plantigrade foot, where varus/valgus and internal/external rotation were determined using the tibial alignment guide from the prosthesis manufacturer. Axially loaded lateral radiographs were made to measure the tibiotalar ratio (TTR) preoperatively and postoperatively. Specimens were prepared for gait simulation and mounted into the robotic gait simulator. Foot bone kinematics and plantar pressures were measured for each alignment condition.
Posterior malalignment of the talar component decreased mean sagittal-plane range of motion (p ≤ 0.0005) in the tibiotalar joint (by up to 3.9°) and in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (by up to 7.7°) and increased sagittal-plane range of motion (p ≤ 0.0005) in the calcaneocuboid joint (by up to 2.0°). Posterior malalignment increased mean transverse-plane range of motion (p ≤ 0.0005 and p = 0.012) in the tibiotalar joint (by up to 2.3°) and in the calcaneocuboid joint (by 2.3°). Posterior malalignment decreased mean peak plantar pressures (p = 0.001 and p = 0.013) under the hallux and the first metatarsal (by up to 82.1 and 110.1 kPa, respectively) and increased (p = 0.012 and p = 0.0006) peak plantar pressures under the third metatarsal and the hindfoot (by 23.0 and 47.8 kPa, respectively). Anterior malalignment decreased (p = 0.0006) mean hindfoot peak plantar pressure (by 127.7 kPa). Anterior and posterior malalignments shifted center of pressure laterally during early and late stance. The TTR weakly to moderately correlated with range-of-motion changes in the tibiotalar, calcaneocuboid, and first metatarsophalangeal joints (r ≤ 0.39) and weakly correlated with plantar pressure changes under the hindfoot, the first metatarsal, and the hallux (r ≤ 0.15).
Anterior and posterior malalignments of the talar component altered foot bone kinematics and plantar pressures. Mild malalignments produced fewer significant differences than moderate and extreme malalignments. A greater number of significant differences were found for posterior malalignments than for anterior. The TTR weakly to moderately correlated with changes in range of motion and plantar pressures.
The observed changes in range of motion and plantar pressures may explain why malaligned ankle arthroplasties are associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and poor prosthesis longevity. Posterior malalignments may produce worse clinical outcomes than anterior malalignments."|||Posterior malalignment of the talar component decreased mean sagittal-plane range of motion (p ≤ 0.0005) in the tibiotalar joint (by up to 3.9°) and in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (by up to 7.7°) and increased sagittal-plane range of motion (p ≤ 0.0005) in the calcaneocuboid joint (by up to 2.0°).

The secondary objective was to assess the specific complications.
This monocentric retrospective series includes 12 patients (nine men, three women, average age 52.5 years) operated between 2003 and 2018. An iliac graft was used in all cases. The arthrodesis was stabilized either by screws or by retrograde nailing.

Debate continues whether a mobile-bearing total ankle replacement (MB-TAR) or a fixed-bearing total ankle replacement (FB-TAR) is superior, with successful outcomes reported long term for MB-TAR and at intermediate- to long-term follow-up for newer generation FB-TAR. Although comparisons between the 2 total ankle designs have been reported, to our knowledge, no investigation has compared the 2 designs with a high level of evidence. This prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institution compares patient satisfaction, functional outcomes, and radiographic results of the mobile-bearing STAR and the fixed-bearing Salto-Talaris in the treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis.
Between November 2011 and November 2014, adult patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis failing nonoperative treatment were introduced to the study. With informed consent, 100 patients (31 male and 69 female, average age 65 years, range 35-85 years) were enrolled; a demographic comparison between the 2 cohorts was similar. Exclusion criteria included inflammatory arthropathy, neuropathy, weight exceeding 250 pounds, radiographic coronal plane deformity greater than 15 degrees, or extensive talar dome wear pattern (""flat-top talus""). Prospective patient-reported outcomes, physical examination, and standardized weightbearing ankle radiographs were obtained preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, and then at yearly intervals. Data collection included visual analog pain score, Short Form 36, Foot and Ankle Disability Index, Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment, and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score. Surgeries were performed by a nondesign team of orthopedic foot and ankle specialists with total ankle replacement expertise. Statistical analysis was performed by a qualified statistician. At average follow-up of 4.5 years (range, 2-6 years) complete clinical data and radiographs were available for 84 patients; 7 had incomplete data, 1 had died, 4 were withdrawn after enrolling but prior to surgery, and 4 were lost to follow-up.
In all outcome measures, the entire cohort demonstrated statistically significant improvements from preoperative evaluation to most recent follow-up with no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Radiographically, tibial lucency/cyst formation was 26.8% and 20.9% for MB-TAR and FB-TAR, respectively. Tibial settling/subsidence occurred in 7.3% of MB-TAR. Talar lucency/cyst formation occurred in 24.3% and 2.0% of MB-TAR and FB-TAR, respectively. Talar subsidence was observed in 21.9% and 2.0% of MB-TAR and FH-TAR, respectively. Reoperations were performed in 8 MB-TARs and 3 FH-TARs, with the majority of procedures being to relieve impingement or treat cysts and not to revise or remove metal implants.
With a high level of evidence, our study found that patient-reported and clinical outcomes were favorable for both designs and that there was no significant difference in clinical improvement between the 2 implants. The incidence of lucency/cyst formation was similar for MB-TAR and FH-TAR for the tibial component, but the MB-TAR had greater talar lucency/cyst formation and tibial and talar subsidence. As has been suggested in previous studies, clinical outcomes do not necessarily correlate with radiographic findings. Reoperations were more common for MB-TAR and, in most cases, were to relieve impingement or treat cysts rather than revise or remove metal implants.

The biomechanical effects of them on the inner foot are insufficient to identify which is superior. This study compared biomechanical parameters among a foot treated by ankle arthrodesis, a foot treated by total ankle arthroplasty, and an intact foot using computational analysis. Validated finite element models of the three feet were developed and used to simulate the stance phase of gait. The results showed total ankle arthroplasty provides a more stable plantar pressure distribution than ankle arthrodesis. The highest contact pressure, 3.17 MPa, occurred in the medial cuneonavicular joint in the total ankle arthroplasty foot. Neither of the surgeries resulted in contact pressure increase in the subtalar joint. The peak stress in the metatarsal bones was increased in both surgical models, especially the second and third metatarsals. This study enables us to get visual to the biomechanics inside of an intact foot, and feet treated by total ankle arthroplasty and ankle arthrodesis during walking.|||||10.1038/s41598-019-50091-6|2019-09-19|[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Duo Wai-Chi', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Qitao', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Zengyong', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'The National Research Center for Rehabilitation Technical Aids, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Ming', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China. ming.zhang@polyu.edu.hk.\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China. ming.zhang@polyu.edu.hk.'}]

The purpose of this study was to evaluate intermediate-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of TAA in patients with ligamentous post-traumatic osteoarthritis and compare them with results of TAA for patients with primary osteoarthritis.
We enrolled 114 patients (119 ankles) with consecutive primary TAA using HINTEGRA prosthesis at a mean follow-up duration of 6.0 years (range, 3-13). We divided all patients into 2 groups according to the etiology of osteoarthritis: (1) primary osteoarthritis group (69 ankles) and (2) ligamentous post-traumatic osteoarthritis group (50 ankles).

Ankle joint arthroplasty has been performed increasingly more often as an alternative to arthrodesis. The aim of this study was to compare arthrodesis and arthroplasty in the treatment of ankle osteoarthritis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study involved 56 patients (45 males and 11 females) aged 21-72 years (mean 51) presenting with end-stage ankle OA: 29 patients (52%) underwent arthroplasty (Group A) and 27 patients (48%) underwent arthrodesis (Group B). Patients underwent surgery between 2004 and 2016 at a single clinical center. The observation period ranged from 6 to 150 months (mean 55 months). To assess the results of surgical treatment, quality of life (Health Assessment Questionnaire-HAQ, 12-Item Short-Form Survey-SF-12) and functional (American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle-AOFAS, Kofoed, Takakura) scores were used. For pain assessment, Visual Analog Scale was used (VAS). RESULTS After the surgery, group A and B had a statistically significant improvement in the joint function and pain relief according to AOFAS (A: 32.6 to 68.2; B: 27.4 to 61.3), Kofoed (A: 31.8 to 68; B: 25.9 to 60.3), Takakura (A: 30.6 to 62.9; B: 25.4 to 49.3), and VAS scores (A: 7.28 to 4.14; B: 7.33 to 3.78) compared with preoperative scores. After the surgery, quality of life scores improved in both groups, for HAQ (A: 0.91 to 0.53; B: 1.34 to 0.56) and for SF-12 (A: 26.6 to 36.8; B: 25.6 to 38.0).

The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of implant material and implant-bone interface conditions on bone remodelling around tibia bone due to total ankle replacement. Finite element models of intact and implanted ankles were developed using CT scan data sets. Bone remodelling algorithm was used in combination with FE analysis to predict the bone density changes around the ankle joint. Dorsiflexion, neutral, and plantar flexion positions were considered, along with muscle force and ligaments. Implant-bone interfacial conditions were assumed as debonded and bonded to represent non-osseointegration and fully osseointegration at the porous coated surface of the implant. To investigate the effect of implant material, three finite element models having different material combinations of the implant were developed. For model 1, tibial and talar components were made of Co-Cr-Mo, and meniscal bearing was made of UHMWPE. For model 2, tibial and talar components were made of ceramic and meniscal bearing was made of UHMWPE. For model 3, tibial and talar components were made of ceramic and meniscal bearing was made of CFR-PEEK. Changes in implant material showed no significant changes in bone density due to bone remodelling. Therefore, ceramic appears to be a viable alternative to metal and CFR-PEEK can be used in place of UHMWPE. This study also indicates that proper bonding between implant and bone is essential for long-term survival of the prosthetic components.|||||10.1080/10255842.2019.1661385|2019-09-10|[{'lastname': 'Mondal', 'firstname': 'Subrata', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi , Mandi , India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghosh', 'firstname': 'Rajesh', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi , Mandi , India.'}]
187|31483394|Outcomes of Total Ankle Replacement, Arthroscopic Ankle Arthrodesis, and Open Ankle Arthrodesis for Isolated Non-Deformed End-Stage Ankle Arthritis.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"End-stage ankle arthritis is a disabling condition that has a similar effect on morbidity, pain, and loss of function to hip arthritis. We compared clinical outcomes of total ankle replacement (TAR) involving the HINTEGRA prosthesis (Integra LifeSciences), arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis (AAA), and open ankle arthrodesis (OAA) in patients with isolated, non-deformed end-stage ankle arthritis.
Patients ≥18 years old who underwent TAR, AAA, or OAA from 2002 to 2012 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were retrospectively identified from the Canadian Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (COFAS) Prospective Ankle Reconstruction Database. All patients had symptomatic COFAS Type-1 end-stage ankle arthritis without intra-articular or extra-articular deformity or surrounding joint arthritis. Clinical outcomes included the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) and Short Form-36 (SF-36). Revision was defined as removal of 1 or both metal ankle prosthesis components for TAR and as reoperation for malposition, malunion, or nonunion for AAA and OAA.
Analysis included 238 ankles (88 TAR, 50 AAA, and 100 OAA) in 229 patients with a mean follow-up of 43.3 ± 18.5 months. The TAR group had more female patients (55%; p = 0.0318) and a higher mean age (p = 0.0005). Preoperative AOS pain, disability, and total scores were similar for all groups. SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores were similar across groups, both preoperatively and postoperatively. Improvement in AOS total score was significantly larger for TAR (34.4 ± 22.6) and AAA (38.3 ± 23.6) compared with OAA (25.8 ± 25.5; p = 0.005). Improvement in AOS disability score was also significantly larger for TAR (36.7 ± 24.3) and AAA (40.5 ± 26.4) compared with OAA (26.0 ± 26.2; p = 0.0013). However, the greater improvements did not meet the minimal clinically important difference. The TAR group underwent more reoperations than AAA and OAA groups (p < 0.0001). Revision rates were similar for all 3 groups (p = 0.262).
AAA and OAA resulted in comparable clinical outcomes to TAR in patients with non-deformed, COFAS Type-1 end-stage ankle arthritis. The rate of component revision in patients who underwent TAR was similar to the rate of revision for patients who underwent AAA or OAA; however, TAR patients underwent a greater number of additional procedures. Overall, AAA and TAR involving the HINTEGRA prosthesis were not significantly different surgical options in terms of short-term outcomes; patients should be counseled regarding higher reoperation rates for TAR.

We also report favorable results from our method of treatment using a total talar prosthesis in the revision surgery. During the revision surgery, synovial metallosis was found, probably related to superficial damage to the screw affixing the tibial component to the bone. Because both the tibial and talar components were loose, all the components and the remaining talar bone were removed. A new tibial component and a custom-made alumina-ceramic total talar prosthesis was inserted. Pain relief was achieved and maintained through the latest follow-up visit at 42 months after revision surgery. Dorsiflexion of the ankle improved from 0° to 5° and plantarflexion remained unchanged from its preoperative range of 20°. The American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score improved from 38 to 80 points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an alumina-ceramic total ankle prosthesis loosening caused by metallosis resulting from screw abrasion. Favorable treatment results were obtained by using a total talar prosthesis in the revision surgery.||||Copyright © 2019.

Total ankle arthroplasty continues to emerge as a safe and effective treatment of ankle arthritis. Ankle arthroplasty preserves motion at the ankle joint, while still achieving the primary goal of pain relief. With encouraging outcomes and improved implant longevity, there has been significant improvement on the results of first-generation implants. Further high-quality studies are required to clarify outcomes post ankle arthroplasty. This article reviews the latest data from national registries and the wider literature to evaluate the current status with outcomes of modern total ankle replacements.||||Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is little known about the relationship between postoperatively collected patient-reported outcomes and objective clinical outcomes. The objective of this study was to measure whether postoperative Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) values were associated with risk of revision among patients having ankle arthrodesis or total ankle arthroplasty for treatment of symptomatic end-stage ankle arthritis.
This is a retrospective analysis of a longitudinal cohort of ankle arthrodesis and total ankle arthroplasty patients. A single center recruited patients between 2003 and 2013 and follow-up was at least 4 years. Patients completed the AOS preoperatively and annually following surgery. An extended Cox regression model incorporating time-varying AOS values was used to model risk of failure. A total of 336 patients and 348 ankles were included, representing 139 ankle arthrodesis procedures and 209 total ankle arthroplasties.
The median follow-up time for revisions was 8.2 years and 46 patients had a revision. Higher values of patients' AOS scores in the postoperative period were associated with a higher likelihood of revision (hazard ratio, 1.04 per 1-point increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.05). Ankle arthrodesis was associated with a reduced risk of revision compared with ankle fusion (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.49).
This study showed that persistent pain and poor function after fusion or replacement surgery, as measured by elevated values of the AOS, were associated with higher risk of further surgery.

194|31436657|Effectiveness and Safety of Ankle Arthrodesis Versus Arthroplasty: A Prospective Multicenter Study.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Newer designs and techniques of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) have challenged the assumption of ankle arthrodesis (AA) as the primary treatment for end-stage ankle arthritis. The objective of this study was to compare physical and mental function, ankle-specific function, pain intensity, and rates of revision surgery and minor complications between these 2 procedures and to explore heterogeneous treatment effects due to age, body mass index (BMI), patient sex, comorbidities, and employment on patients treated by 1 of these 2 methods.
This was a multisite prospective cohort study comparing outcomes of surgical treatment of ankle arthritis. Subjects who presented after nonoperative management had failed received either TAA or AA using standard-of-treatment care and rehabilitation. Outcomes included the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS) scores, pain, ankle-related adverse events, and treatment success.
Five hundred and seventeen participants underwent surgery and completed a baseline assessment. At 24 months, the mean improvement in FAAM activities of daily living (ADL) and SF-36 PCS scores was significantly greater in the TAA group than in the AA group, with a difference between groups of 9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3, 15) and 4 points (95% CI = 1, 7), respectively. The crude incidence risks of revision surgery and complications were greater in the AA group; however, these differences were no longer significant after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI). The treatment success rate was greater after TAA than after AA for those with an FCI of 4 (80% versus 62%) and not fully employed (81% versus 58%) but similar for those with an FCI score of 2 (81% versus 77%) and full-time employment (79% versus 78%).
At 2-year follow-up, both AA and TAA were effective. Improvement in several patient-reported outcomes was greater after TAA than after AA, without a significant difference in the rates of revision surgery and complications.

Utilizing the terms ""(risk factor OR risk OR risks) AND (infection OR infected) AND (ankle replacement OR ankle arthroplasty)"" we searched the PubMed/MEDLINE electronic databases. The quality of the included studies was then assessed using the AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline and Systematic Review Methodology. Recommendations were made using the overall strength of evidence.
Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. A limited strength of recommendation can be made that the following preoperative patient characteristics correlate with an increased risk of PJI following TAR: inflammatory arthritis, prior ankle surgery, age less than 65 years, body mass index less than 19, peripheral vascular disease, chronic lung disease, hypothyroidism, and low preoperative AOFAS hindfoot scores. There is conflicting evidence in the literature regarding the effect of obesity, tobacco use, diabetes, and duration of surgery.
Several risk factors were identified as having an association with PJI following TAR. These factors may alert surgeons that a higher rate of PJI is possible.

196|31425279|When is it Safe to Drive After Total Ankle Arthroplasty?|[]|Clinical orthopaedics and related research|"With the increase in the number of total ankle arthroplasties (TAA), guidelines on when physicians should begin to consider patients' return to driving are valuable. Further, due to sagittal motion strength, the ankle is the most important mover in braking motions over the knee and hip.
(1) Does brake-reaction time return to a safe value within 6 weeks of TAA? (2) Are there factors associated with a delay of return of brake-reaction time to safe values after TAA?
After obtaining institutional review board approval for the study, we prospectively recruited 60 patients undergoing right TAA. A large proportion of the patients undergoing TAA during the period were recruited. Patients who had extensive concomitant surgery, such as triple arthrodesis or tibial osteotomy, were excluded from the study. Patients were between 43 and 83 years old (median, 63 years), and 35 (59%) were men. Brake-reaction time was tested at 6 weeks postoperatively and repeated weekly until patients achieved a passing brake-reaction time. A control group of 20 volunteer participants matched for age and sex who did not have right lower-extremity pathology or pain were used to establish a passing brake-reaction time of 0.850 seconds. Patients were given a novel driver-readiness survey to complete; a score of 10 of 15 points or higher was considered a passing score. The following factors were explored for their association with brake-reaction time: age, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS)-Hindfoot assessment and VAS for pain via a patient-reported survey, and ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion via dedicated weightbearing lateral radiographs made with the ankle in maximum plantarflexion and dorsiflexion.
At 6 weeks postoperatively, 92% of patients (54 of 59) achieved a passing brake-reaction time and were considered able to drive safely, and the mean brake-reaction time of the patients with a passing brake-reaction time was 0.626 seconds (± 0.111). At 9 weeks, all patients who completed the study achieved a passing brake-reaction time. Patients with a failed brake-reaction time at 6 weeks had greater median VAS scores for pain (3 [interquartile range 2 to 7] versus 1 [IQR 0 to 3]; p = 0.022) and diminished ankle plantarflexion (14° [± 5°] versus 24° [± 10°]; p = 0.037) compared with those with a passing brake-reaction time at that time point. All five patients with a failed brake-reaction time also had a failing score for the driver-readiness survey.
More than 90% of patients in this series achieved a safe brake-reaction time within 6 weeks of TAA, and those who did not were more likely to have had more pain and a stiffer ankle. Surgeons might counsel patients with persistent pain and stiffness at 6 weeks to delay driving for an additional 3 weeks, since by 9 weeks after TAA, all patients in this series had a brake-reaction time comparable with patients who had not undergone surgery. Future studies might elucidate what key gaps in knowledge remain and determine a practical way to answer these questions.

We retrospectively reviewed 93 end-stage ankle arthritis patients who had preoperative nonweightbearing ankle computed tomography (CT) and identified a cohort of 83 nonarthritic ankle patients as a demographic-matched control group. A region of interest tool was used to calculate Hounsfield unit (HU) values in the cancellous region of the tibia and talus. Measurements were obtained on axial cut CTs from 6 to 12 mm above the tibial plafond, and 1 to 4 mm below the talar dome. HU measurements between groups and the decrease of HU at the relative level in each group were compared.

Seventeen observational studies were included in the review, with 1127 and 262 ankles in the 5 and 10 years minimum follow-up groups respectively.
Mean difference between pre- and post-operative AOFAS score was 43.60 (95%CI: 37.51-49.69, p<0.001) at 5 years minimum follow-up. At 5 years minimum follow-up, pooled proportion (PP) of prostheses revision for any reason other than polyethylene exchange was 0.122 (95%CI: 0.084-0.173), all cause revision was 0.185 (95%CI: 0.131-0.256), unplanned reoperation was 0.288 (95%CI: 0.204-0.390) and all infection was 0.033 (95%CI: 0.021-0.051). At 10 years minimum follow-up, PP of prostheses revision for any reason other than polyethylene exchange was 0.202 (95%CI: 0.118-0.325), all cause revision was 0.305 (95%CI: 0.191-0.448), unplanned reoperation was 0.422 (95%CI: 0.260-0.603) and all infection was 0.029 (95%CI: 0.013-0.066).
Despite good intermediate and long-term functional outcome measures, TAA has relatively higher revision surgery prevalence with longer follow-up periods. Further research should be directed towards identifying patient populations that would best benefit from TAA and those at greatest risk of requiring revision surgery."|Despite good intermediate and long-term functional outcome measures, TAA has relatively higher revision surgery prevalence with longer follow-up periods.

Our aim was to better understand the axial rotational profile of patients undergoing TAR.
In 157 standardized computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with end-stage ankle arthritis planning to undergo primary TAR surgery, we measured the relationship between the knee posterior condylar axis, the tibial tuberosity, the transmalleolar axis (TMA), and the tibiotalar angle. The foot position was measured in relation to the TMA with the foot plantigrade. The variation between the medial gutter line and the line bisecting both gutters was assessed.
The mean external tibial torsion was 34.5 ± 10.3 degrees (11.8-62 degrees). When plantigrade, the mean foot position relative to the TMA was 21 ± 10.6 degrees (0.7-38.4 degrees) internally rotated. As external tibial torsion increased, the foot position became more internally rotated relative to the TMA (Pearson correlation, 0.6;

The correction of this deformity is paramount to the long-term survival of the implant. Coronal plane correction is achieved with soft tissue balancing and, in some part, is maintained through articular geometry constraint. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of tibial component stem length on the coronal plane stability.
A consecutive case series of stemmed implants that met inclusion criteria were reviewed to determine the correction and maintenance of the correction of coronal plane deformity with special emphasis on the effect of modular tibial stem lengths of 2 and >2 segments. Twenty patients received a tibial component with 2 stem segments, and 23 patients received a tibial component with >2 stem segments. At an average patient age of 62.1 years at implantation, there was no significant difference between the 2 cohorts with respect to preoperative deformity or demographics.
Our case series had a mean coronal deformity of 5.7 degrees, with valgus being more common than varus. At a mean final radiographic follow-up of 266.3 days after the first postoperative weightbearing radiography, coronal deformity increased by 0.4 degrees (

Individuals were recruited from a cohort of individuals who had undergone total ankle replacement or ankle fusion. English-speaking individuals who had surgery at least 1 year prior were invited to participate. Semistructured, face-to-face interviews relying on a phenomenological approach were conducted in a private hospital clinic room.
A total of 25 adults (12 women, 13 men), ages 25-82 years, were interviewed for 1-2 hours. Participants commonly described a state of having to keep careful watch for potential environmental challenges. Vigilance was related to ongoing symptoms (i.e., pain, stiffness) and concerns regarding balance, stability, and potential damage to the fused ankle or implant. Vigilance was described along a continuum, with higher levels associated with stress and mental exhaustion. Vigilance affected participants' perception of their surgical outcome, with high vigilance levels linked to negative perceptions of outcome. The degree to which individuals perceived the need for vigilance was influenced by environmental factors like uneven ground or crowds. Contrary to descriptions of vigilance in the coping literature, vigilance related to ankle reconstruction constituted a situational, rather than dispositional, response.
Vigilance and its associated burden are not captured by current instruments. The mental load and worry associated with vigilance was important to patients, distinct from related pain or functional status. Thus, reducing high levels of vigilance appears to be an appropriate target for patient-centered treatment outcomes.

235|31274719|Step Activity After Surgical Treatment of Ankle Arthritis.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Ambulatory activity is reduced in patients with ankle arthritis. In this study, we measured step activity over time in 2 treatment groups and secondarily compared step activity with results of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
Patients who were treated with either ankle arthrodesis or ankle arthroplasty wore a step activity monitor preoperatively and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively. Changes from preoperative baseline in total steps per day and per-day metrics of low, medium, and high-activity step counts were measured in both treatment groups. Step activity was compared with each subject's PROM scores as reported on the Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (MFA) and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical function and bodily pain subscales.
Of the 3 activity levels, combined group high-activity step counts showed the greatest increase (mean of 278 steps [95% confidence interval (CI), 150 to 407 steps], a 46% improvement from preoperatively). At 6 months, the mean high-activity step improvement for the arthroplasty group was 194 steps compared with a mean decline of 44 steps for the arthrodesis group (mean 238-step difference [95% CI, -60 to 536 steps]). By 36 months postoperatively, the greater improvement in high-activity steps for the arthroplasty versus the arthrodesis group was no longer present. There were no significant pairwise differences in improvement based on surgical treatment method at any individual follow-up time point. For a within-patient increase of 1,000 total steps, there was a mean change in the MFA, SF-36 physical function, and SF-36 bodily pain scores of -1.8 (95% CI, -2.4 to -1.2), 3.8 (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.8), and 2.8 (95% CI, 1.8 to 3.9), respectively (p < 0.0001 for all associations). There was no evidence that the association differed by study visit, or by study visit and surgical procedure interaction (p > 0.10).
Surgical treatment of ankle arthritis significantly improves ambulatory activity, with greater change occurring at high activity levels. Improvement may occur more quickly following arthroplasty than arthrodesis, but at 3 years, we detected no significant difference between the 2 procedures. Step counts, while associated with PROMs, do not parallel them, and thus may be a useful supplementary measure, particularly in longitudinal studies.

Furthermore, the effect of implant position on TAA kinematics is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare ankle and hindfoot kinematics pre- and post-TAA during simulated gait and determine to what degree tibial component position correlated with variations in ankle kinematics.
Eight midtibia cadaveric specimens were utilized in this institutional review board-approved study. The stance phase of gait was simulated both pre- and post-TAA in each specimen using a 6 degrees of freedom robotic platform. Ankle and hindfoot kinematics were measured from reflective markers attached to bones via surgical pins. The effect of tibial component position on absolute differences in ankle kinematics was assessed using linear regression.
No differences were observed in ankle sagittal and coronal plane motion between the intact and TAA conditions. Differences in ankle joint kinematics were identified in the transverse plane, where internal talar rotation was significantly increased following TAA compared with the native condition. The medial-lateral position of the tibial component was found to correlate with the altered transverse plane motion observed after TAA (β = 1.861 degrees/mm,

Although multiple risk factors have been shown to contribute to early component revision, no study has looked at combining such risk factors into a predictive model that could potentially decrease revision rates and improve implant survival. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for TAA failure based on patient characteristics, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and immediate postoperative radiographs.
A retrospective review of a single-site ankle arthritis database was conducted. All patients with current-generation ankle replacements including the Hintegra and Infinity prostheses implanted between 2004 and 2015 and with complete postoperative radiographs taken between 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively were included. Eight coronal and sagittal radiographic parameters were assessed and performed twice by 2 independent orthopedic surgeons on included TAAs. These radiographic parameters were then analyzed in association with patient demographics and PRO. Advanced statistical methods including survival analysis were used to construct a predictive model for TAA survival. A total of 107 patients were included and analyzed with a median clinical follow-up of 49 months (minimum 24 months).
A predictive model was created, with 4 parameters identified as being statistically associated with TAA metal-component revision: diabetes mellitus, poor baseline Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) score, excessively dorsiflexed talar component, and an anteriorly/posteriorly translated talus relative to the tibial axis. The presence of 3 parameters predicted TAA survival of 0.60 whereas presence of all 4 parameters predicted survival of only 0.13 in the period studied.
Our predictive model is based on a combination of patient factors, PROs, and radiographic TAA alignment. We believe it can be used by surgeons to predict failure in their TAA patients, thereby optimizing postoperative outcomes by improving patient selection and modifiable outcome-specific parameters.

Concern over fatigue resistance has prevented widespread adoption of HXLPE for use in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). The aim of this study was to determine whether HXLPE has sufficient fatigue strength for total ankle arthroplasty under simulated physiologically relevant motion profiles and loading in the ankle.
Physiologic load and motion profiles representative of walking gait were incorporated into a computational model of a semiconstrained, fixed-bearing TAA to determine the loading state with highest stresses in the HXLPE bearing. Subsequent fatigue testing to 10 million cycles (Mc) at 5600 N was performed to assess bearing strength.
Peak stresses in the bearing were predicted at peak axial load and peak dorsiflexion during gait, occurring near heel off. All samples withstood 10 Mc of fatigue loading at that orientation without polyethylene bearing fracture.
HXLPE had sufficient fatigue strength to withstand 10 Mc of loading at more than 5 times body weight at the point of peak stresses during simulated gait in total ankle arthroplasty.
HXLPE may be mechanically strong enough to withstand the in vivo demands of the ankle. Improvements in wear afforded by HXLPE can be obtained without compromising sufficient polyethylene strength properties in total ankle arthroplasty."|HXLPE had sufficient fatigue strength to withstand 10 Mc of loading at more than 5 times body weight at the point of peak stresses during simulated gait in total ankle arthroplasty.||Peak stresses in the bearing were predicted at peak axial load and peak dorsiflexion during gait, occurring near heel off.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the short-term results and complications of TAA with total talar prosthesis, known as combined TAA, as the new techniques to treat such complicated pathology.
We examined postoperative results including ankle range of motion, Japanese Society for Surgery of the Foot (JSSF) scale, and complications. There were 22 patients (15 women), with mean follow-up of 34.9 (range, 24-53 months), and the mean age was 72 (range, 62-80) years. The main indications for combined TAA included osteoarthritis (18 patients), rheumatoid arthritis (3 patients), and talar osteonecrosis with osteoarthritis (one patient).
The mean range of motion improved from 4.0 to 14.4 degrees in dorsiflexion and from 23.8 to 32.0 degrees in plantarflexion. The JSSF scale improved from 50.5 to 91.5 points. Prolonged wound healing occurred in 3 patients, and medial malleolus fracture occurred in 4 patients.

Little has been published on the importance of sagittal talar alignment in TAA. The radiographic talar component inclination was hypothesized to be predictive of TAA survival, subsidence, and functional outcomes.
A retrospective review of the Vancouver End-Stage Ankle Arthritis Database was performed on all TAAs at a single center over 11 years utilizing 1 of 2 implants. Talar component inclination (TCI) angles were measured and standard descriptive statistics were completed with a survival analysis. Inter- and intraobserver reliability were determined. Postoperative TCI angles were analyzed against several definitions of TAA survival and patient-reported outcome measures from the database. A total of 109 TAAs satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria.
A postoperative talar component inclination angle greater than 22 degrees was associated with talar component anterior subsidence, defined as a change in that angle of 5 degrees or more between postoperative and last available radiographs. This was still significant after adjusting for confounders: age, gender, body mass index, and presence of inflammatory arthritis. All measured angles had good inter- and intraobserver reliability.
Surgeons should avoid dorsiflexing the talar prosthesis during TAA, which hypothetically diminishes the ankle critical dorsiflexion range. This may cause anterior talar undercoverage in terminal dorsiflexion and may edge load the talar prosthesis, predisposing to anterior subsidence. Elevated TCI was a simple and reliable radiographic measurement to predict long-term TAA outcome due to predictable anterior subsidence of the talar prosthesis.

The aims of this study were to determine the relative importance of pre- and post-TAR coronal and sagittal balance on postoperative patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). A total of 101 ankles in 99 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were scored preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years by using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot-ankle score, the Short Form-36 measures, and a set of radiographic measurements to define the sagittal and coronal alignment. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the anterior or posterior translation of the talus preoperatively. There were no statistically significant correlations between any preoperative measure and any domain of the PROM data. Significant correlations were observed between postoperative medial distal tibial angle and the function domain of the FAOS and the AOFAS hindfoot-ankle score. Preoperative coronal and sagittal plane deformity are not markedly different, depending on the diagnosis. Preoperative deformity does not appear to correlate significantly with postoperative function, as measured by the PROM scores. Postoperative sagittal plane alignment does not correlate significantly with postoperative function, as measured by PROMs. Coronal plane alignment, as measured by the medial distal tibial angle, may be associated with postoperative function, as measured on the AOFAS hindfoot-ankle and FAOS function subscales.||||Copyright © 2018 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

This can be managed surgically either by ankle arthrodesis or total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). Although ankle arthrodesis is considered by some as the standard-of-care surgical option for this condition, it restricts range of motion and may lead to accelerated osteoarthritis of neighboring joints. Better understanding of ankle biomechanics, the biological effects of orthopaedic devices, and new surgical techniques have led to significant improvements in the designs of TAAs, and over the last several decades TAA has been used increasingly to treat patients with end-stage tibiotalar osteoarthritis. However, complication and ultimate failure rates remain greater than those seen with total knee and hip arthroplasty, and imaging is often critical in determining whether a prosthesis is beginning to fail. As a result, imagers should be familiar with the basic types of TAAs in clinical use, the normal radiographic appearances, as well as the common complications seen with this procedure.||||Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.|10.1055/s-0038-1677466|2019-03-30|[{'lastname': 'Omar', 'firstname': 'Imran M', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Abboud', 'firstname': 'Samir F', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Youngner', 'firstname': 'Jonathan M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.'}]

A literature review was performed detailing the natural history and origin of symptoms in a meniscus-deficient knee, in addition to strategies for non-surgical management, meniscus scaffolds, meniscus allograft transplantation (MAT), isolated cartilage repair, unloading osteotomies, meniscus prosthesis, and joint replacements which were revealed as treatment possibilities.
Meniscus deficiency was recognized to lead to an early onset knee osteoarthritis (OA). A subset of patients develop post-meniscectomy syndrome: dull and nagging pain after a short pain-free interval subsequently to meniscectomy, which can be accompanied by transient effusions. Evidence for non-surgical management of post-meniscectomy knee pain is lacking. Two available meniscus scaffolds, indicated for symptomatic segmental meniscus deficiency, show pain relief at mid-term follow-up, and effect on joint preservation is unclear. MAT represents a durable solution for sub/total meniscus deficiency (80% survival at 10 years), but it is still considered a temporary solution for post-meniscectomy pain. MAT may also reduce the progression of OA. Isolated cartilage repair without a meniscus reconstruction is commonly performed, but better results were reported with preserved or reconstructed menisci. Osteotomies are used in the combination of misaligned knee and meniscus reconstruction or as pain solution for irreversible unilateral knee structural changes following a meniscectomy. Polycarbonate-urethane medial meniscus prosthesis is currently undergoing clinical trial. Joint replacements should be limited to later stages of post-meniscectomy OA.
Post-meniscectomy pain syndrome and post-meniscectomy knee OA are common findings after meniscus resection. Short-term pain relief is provided by non-surgical management, mid-term pain relief by meniscus scaffolds, and long-term relief by MAT, though each has differing indications. In later stages, osteotomies and joint replacements are indicated.

The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm for the management of patients with postoperative periprosthetic fractures about a TAR.
This was a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing a TAR from 2007 through 2017 with a subsequent periprosthetic fracture >4 weeks from index surgery. Implant stability was defined radiographically and intraoperatively where appropriate. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify differences in outcomes. Thirty-two patients were identified with a remote TAR periprosthetic fracture with an average follow-up of 26 months (range, 3-104 months).
Most fractures were located about the medial malleolus (62.5%); the majority of fractures (75%) were deemed to have stable implants. Fractures of the talus always had unstable implants and always required revision TAR surgery (100%, P = .0002). There was no difference in patient-reported outcomes between stable and unstable fractures at an average of 36 months. In a multivariate analysis, fracture location (talus), less time to fracture, and implant type were found to be predictive of unstable implants ( P < .001). Implant stability was independently associated with the need for revision surgery ( P < .049). Nonoperative treatment was independently associated with treatment failure ( P < .001).
The majority of stable fractures about a TAR required operative fixation. Management with immobilization was fraught with a high rate of subsequent surgical intervention. We found that fractures about the talus required revision TAR surgery or arthrodesis.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is capable to evaluate areal bone mineral density (BMD) around different prosthetic implants, but no studies evaluated periprosthetic bone around total ankle replacement (TAR). Our aim is to determine the precision of the DXA periprosthetic BMD around TAR.
Short-term precision was evaluated on 15 consecutive patients. Each ankle was scanned 3 times both in the posteroanterior (PA) and lateral views with a dedicated patient positioning protocol. Up to four squared regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the periprosthetic bone around tibial and talar implants, with an additional ROI to include the calcaneal body in the lateral scan. Coefficient of variation (CV%) and least significant change were calculated according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry.
The lateral projection showed lower mean CV values compared to the PA projection, with an average precision error of 2.21% (lateral scan) compared to 3.34% (PA scans). Overall, the lowest precision error was found at both ""global"" ROIs (CV = 1.25% on PA and CV = 1.3% on lateral). The highest CV value on PA was found at the medial aspect of talar side (ROI 3; CV = 4.89%), while on the lateral scan the highest CV value was found on the posterior aspect of talar side (ROI 2; CV = 2.99%).
We found very good reproducibility BMD values of periprosthetic bone around TAR, that were comparable or even better compared to other studies that evaluated periprosthetic BMD around different prosthetic implants. DXA can be used to precisely monitor bone density around ankle prostheses, despite further long-term longitudinal studies are required to assess the clinical utility of such measurements."|||"The lateral projection showed lower mean CV values compared to the PA projection, with an average precision error of 2.21% (lateral scan) compared to 3.34% (PA scans).

Multiple costs and time measures were taken from 730 consecutive patients over 5 years at either an inpatient facility or ASC. The relationships between total cost and operative time and multiple variables were examined, using multivariate analysis and regression modeling. The mean operative cost over 4 years was significantly greater at the inpatient facility than at the outpatient facility. Significant cost drivers of this difference were inpatient, physical and occupational therapy, pharmacy, and operating room costs. The most significant predictor of cost was facility type.

266|30730479|The Effect of Patient Characteristics on 1 to 2-Year and Minimum 5-Year Outcomes After Total Ankle Arthroplasty.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Total ankle arthroplasty has shown durable improvements in patient-reported outcomes. However, the impact of common comorbidities and patient factors has not been fully characterized. The purpose of this study was to identify patient comorbidities and characteristics that impact outcomes after total ankle arthroplasty.
Patients who underwent a total ankle arthroplasty between January 2007 and December 2016 were enrolled into a prospective study at a single academic center. Patients completed outcome measures before the surgical procedure and at the time of follow-up: a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36), and the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA). Patient and operative factors, along with prevalent preoperative comorbidities, were analyzed for association with preoperative to postoperative changes in 1 to 2-year and minimum 5-year outcomes. Comorbidities that met a significance threshold of p < 0.05 in adjusted analyses were incorporated into multivariable outcome models.
A total of 668 patients with a mean 1 to 2-year follow-up (and standard deviation) of 1.6 ± 0.5 years (range, 10 months to 2 years and 2 months) were included. Patients' pain and function significantly improved across all outcomes (p < 0.05). However, depression, staged bilateral ankle arthroplasty, increased length of stay, a prior surgical procedure, increased American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and particular implant types were associated with significantly smaller improvements in at least 1 patient-reported outcome after total ankle arthroplasty in the 1 to 2-year follow-up, although the effects were relatively small. At a minimum 5-year follow-up, smoking, depression, implant type, and staged bilateral ankle arthroplasty were associated with worse outcomes, and a prior surgical procedure, a simultaneous bilateral surgical procedure, and obesity were associated with improved outcomes.
Patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty had significant improvement in patient-reported outcomes, although several factors were associated with a small, but significant, negative impact on improvement, including depression, increased ASA score, current smoking, increased length of stay, a prior surgical procedure, and staged bilateral total ankle arthroplasty. Current smoking, obesity, and depression are potentially modifiable risk factors that could be improved prior to total ankle arthroplasty. Patients with these characteristics should be counseled on their risk of limited improvement in ankle pain and disability after total ankle arthroplasty.

The goal of this investigation was to determine the associated perioperative risks associated with ankle arthrodesis in this growing population.
The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases identified patients with chronic hepatitis C infection who underwent ankle arthrodesis between January 2009 and December 2013. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes were used to define the primary composite outcome of death or postoperative complication. Logistic models with frequency weights were used to compare propensity matched groups.
7339 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 157 patients had a history of chronic Hepatitis C infection. After performing a propensity score match, the final analytic cohort was 157 in the Hepatitis C group and 386 in the non-Hepatitis C group. There was no statistically significant differences in complications between patients with chronic Hepatitis C undergoing ankle fusion and those without Hepatitis C at any post-operative time point (inpatient, 30 days, or 90 days).
Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection undergoing ankle arthrodesis are not at an elevated risk of inpatient, thirty, and ninety day postoperative complications compared to patients without chronic HCV infections.

Long-term implant survival is a critical outcome to determine the success of the TAR implant. The Buechel-Pappas (BP) implant is a second-generation mobile bearing implant. The aim of this study was to analyze the BP implant survivorship at 10-year follow-up, make a subanalysis between patient groups, and evaluate long-term functional outcomes.
Data of 86 patients who received 101 BP implants between 1993 and 2010 were obtained from a prospectively documented database. Subanalyses were done for patients diagnosed with inflammatory joint disease and noninflammatory joint disease, and patients with preoperative tibiotalar neutral and nonneutral alignment. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used for survival analysis. Long-term functional outcomes were assessed with the following patient-reported outcome measures: Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), Short Form-36 (SF-36) Stand Version 2.0 Health Survey and 3 anchor questions.
The survival rate of the BP implant at 10 years was 86% (95% confidence interval, 78%-93%). A total of 31 patients (36%) required 55 reoperations, and in 13 patients (15%) a revision procedure was performed. In this series, no significant difference in 10-year survival rate was found between neither the inflammatory joint disease and noninflammatory joint disease group ( P = .47), nor the tibiotalar neutral and nonneutral alignment group ( P = .16). At a mean follow-up of 16.8 years for 21 patients, the mean FAOS activities of daily living (ADL) and FAAM ADL subscale scores were 75/100 and 56/100 points. The mean physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) of the SF-36 were 34/100 and 51/100 points, respectively.
A survival rate of 86% was found at 10-year follow-up for the Buechel-Pappas implant. Our series demonstrated no significant difference in 10-year survival rates between the 2 patient subgroups. Long-term results of the various functional outcomes varied between poor and moderate.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of failed ankle OCA transplantation converted to ankle arthrodesis (AA) or total ankle arthroplasty (TAA).
We evaluated 24 patients who underwent salvage procedures (13 AA and 11 TAA) after primary failed ankle OCA transplantation. Reoperations were assessed. Failure of the salvage procedure was defined as an additional surgery that required a revision AA/TAA or amputation. Evaluation among nonfailing ankles included the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Foot and Ankle Module (AAOS-FAM), pain, and satisfaction.
In the salvage AA cohort, 3 patients were classified as failures (2 revision AA and 1 amputation). The 10 nonfailing patients had a mean follow-up of 7.4 years. Eighty-eight percent were satisfied with the procedure, but 63% reported continued problems with their ankle (eg, pain, swelling, stiffness). Mean pain level was 1.9 and AAOS-FAM core score was 83±13. In the salvage TAA cohort, 2 patients were classified as failures (both revision TAA). The 9 nonfailing patients had a mean follow-up of 3.8 years. Fifty percent were satisfied with the procedure, but 40% reported continued problems with their ankle. The mean pain level was 1.3, and the median AAOS-FAM core score was 82±26.
Revision and reoperation rates for salvage procedures following failed OCA transplantation of the ankle are higher compared to published data for primary AA and TAA procedures. However, we believe OCA transplantation can serve as an interim procedure for younger patients with advanced ankle joint disease who may not be ideal candidates for primary AA or TAA at the time of initial presentation.

Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine|The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of implant orientation and implant material on tibia bone strain, implant-bone micromotion, maximum contact pressure, and wear depth at the articulating surface due to total ankle replacement. Three-dimensional finite element models of intact and implanted ankle were developed from computed tomography scan data. Four implanted models were developed having varus and valgus orientations of 5° and 10°, respectively. In order to determine the effect of implant material combination on tibia bone strain, micromotion, contact pressure, and wear depth, three other finite element models were developed having a different material combination of the implant. Dorsiflexion, neutral, and plantarflexion positions were considered as applied loading condition, along with muscle force and ligaments. Implant orientation alters the strain distribution in tibia bone. Strain shielding was found to be less in the case of the optimally positioned implant. Apart from the strain, implant orientation also affects implant-bone micromotion, contact pressure, and wear depth. Implant materials have less influence on tibia bone strain and micromotion. However, wear depth was reduced when ceramic and carbon fibre-reinforced polyetheretherketone material combination was used. Proper orientation of the implant is important to reduce the strain shielding. The present result suggested that ceramic can be used as an alternative to metal and carbon fibre-reinforced polyetheretherketone as an alternative to ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene to reduce wear, which would be beneficial for long-term success and fixation of the implant.|||||10.1177/0954411918823811|2019-01-22|[{'lastname': 'Mondal', 'firstname': 'Subrata', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghosh', 'firstname': 'Rajesh', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India.'}]
273|30653042|Surgeon Type and Outcomes After Inpatient Ankle Arthrodesis and Total Ankle Arthroplasty: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using the Nationwide Premier Healthcare Claims Database.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Two main treatments for end-stage ankle arthritis are ankle arthrodesis and total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). While both procedures can be performed either by a foot and ankle orthopaedic surgeon or a podiatrist (when within a particular state's scope of practice), studies comparing the surgical outcomes of the 2 surgeon types are lacking. Therefore, in this study, we compared outcomes by surgeon type for TAA and for ankle arthrodesis.
This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the nationwide Premier Healthcare claims database (2011 to 2016) regarding TAA (n = 3,674) and ankle arthrodesis (n = 4,980) procedures. Multivariable models estimated associations between surgeon type (podiatrist versus orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon) and opioid utilization (in oral morphine equivalents [OMEs]), length of stay, and cost of hospitalization. We report percent change (compared with reference) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Overall, 76.5% (n = 2,812) and 18.8% (n = 690) of TAA procedures were performed by orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons and podiatrists, respectively; surgeon type was unknown for 4.7% (n = 172). For ankle arthrodesis, 75.3% (n = 3,752) and 18.3% (n = 912) of the procedures were performed by orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons and podiatrists, respectively; surgeon type was unknown for 6.3% (n = 316). The proportion of TAA and ankle arthrodesis procedures performed by podiatrists increased over time, from 12.8% and 13.6% in 2011 to 24.6% and 26.0% in 2016, respectively. When adjusting for relevant covariates, procedures performed by podiatrists (compared with orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons) were associated with increased length of stay: for TAA, +16.7% (95% CI, 7.6% to 26.5%; median, 2 days in both groups) and for ankle arthrodesis, +14.2% (95% CI, 7.9% to 20.9%; median, 3 compared with 2 days) (p < 0.05 for both). In addition, ankle arthrodesis performed by podiatrists was associated with increased cost of hospitalization: +28.5% (95% CI, 22.1% to 35.2%; median, $19,236 compared with $13,433) (p < 0.05). Differences in opioid utilization were nonsignificant in the main analysis: +10.9% (95% CI, -3.1% to 26.8%; median, 345 compared with 250 OMEs) and +2.8% (95% CI, -5.9% to 12.4%; median, 351 compared with 315 OMEs) for TAA and ankle arthrodesis, respectively.
An increasing trend in the proportion of procedures performed by podiatrists was coupled with apparent increases in length of stay and cost compared with procedures performed by orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons. Given the increasing demand for these procedures, factors associated with resource utilization, such as type of surgeon, may be increasingly important on the population level.

We hypothesised that the fluoroscopic navigation would allow more accurate alignment of the prosthesis than conventional techniques. We present our minimum two year follow up data of Infinity ankle replacements.
All total ankle replacements (TARs) performed at our institution were prospectively followed-up with EQ5-D and MOx-FQ scores as well as intra-operative radiation exposure and radiographic alignment data. Post-operative radiographs were used to measure the alignment of the prostheses. We identified 20 implants with minimum of two year follow up which were compared to a control group of 20 Zenith TAR's (Corin, Cirencester, UK).
Intra-operative fluoroscopic navigation has allowed excellent alignment of all prostheses. Median deviations from 90° alignment to the anatomical axis of the tibia were 1.5° and 1.2° in the anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral planes respectively, compared to 2.8° and 3.1° in the Zenith group. This difference reached significance (p=<0.05) using the Mann-Whitney U test. At 2 years, MOx-FQ scores had fallen from pre-operative mean of 63.9∓17.1 to 15∓12.7. EQ-5D VAS scores had improved from 71.3∓17.3 to 81.4∓9.7 points. Radiation exposure had a mean screening time of 82∓29.4s and a decrease in exposure per patient was observed over time. No patients have undergone, or are awaiting, revision surgery. Complications include one intraoperative medial malleolar tip avulsion fracture, one medial malleolar stress fracture, and one patient who developed CRPS.
We present evidence that this system achieves better anatomical alignment of the components when compared to techniques without fluoroscopic navigation.

There is a need to measure symptoms and the impact of interventions on patient's quality of life using valid and reliable patient-reported measurement instruments. The objective of this research was to validate the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale instrument in the preoperative setting using factor analysis, item response theory, and differential item function methods.
This research is based on secondary analysis of patients scheduled for ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement in Vancouver, Canada. Participants completed the instrument between September 2014 and August 2017. Item response theory was used to estimate item difficulty and discrimination parameters, controlling for study participants' underlying level of ankle function. Differential item function was examined for sex, age group, and surgery. There were 88 participants.
Modification indices suggested that item 10, ""walking around the house,"" would better fit the pain domain rather than the disability domain. Items in the pain domain displayed a range of discrimination and difficulty. Items in the disability domain exhibited a range of discrimination, though the disability domain had low difficulty. Differential item functioning for sex, age group, and ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement appeared to be ignorable.
This evaluation of the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale found the instrument to be a strong measure of the effect of pain and dysfunction among patients with end-stage ankle arthritis, even when removing items 7 and 8, supporting its prior use in numerous clinical studies.

Between November 1993 and February 2000, 200 consecutive STAR prostheses were implanted in 184 patients by a single surgeon. Demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively and the last available status was recorded for further survival analysis. All surviving patients underwent regular clinical and radiological review. Pain and function were assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scoring system. The principal endpoint of the study was failure of the implant requiring revision of one or all of the components. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated with 95% confidence intervals and the rate of failure calculated for each year.
A total of 84 patients (87 ankles) were alive by the end of this study. Of the surviving 84 patients (87 ankles; rheumatoid arthritis (RA), n = 40; OA, n = 47), 45 were women and 39 were men, with a mean age of 54 years (18 to 72 years) at the time of surgery. A total of 32 implants failed (16%), requiring revision surgery. The mean time to revision was 80 months (2 to 257). The implant survival at 15.8 years, using revision as an endpoint, was 76.16% (95% confidence interval (CI) 64.41 to 87.91). We found a steady but low decrease in survival over the study period. The mean AOFAS score improved from 28 (10 to 52) preoperatively to 61 (20 to 90) at long-term follow-up.

Preclinical testing of TARs requires reliable in vitro models which, in turn, need thorough knowledge of the kinematics of the tibiotalar joint. Surprisingly few studies have been published to simulate the in vivo kinematics of the tibiotalar joint. Among these studies, there is a wide range of methods and magnitudes of applied loads. The purpose of the present review was to summarize the applied loads, positions that were tested during static simulations, and ranges of motion simulated that have been used in human cadaveric models of the tibiotalar joint. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for studies pertaining to cadaveric tibiotalar joint kinematics. Our search yielded 12 appropriate articles that were included in the systematic review. While it is well known that loads at the tibiotalar joint are frequently as high as 5 times bodyweight [1], these studies reported applied loads varying from 200N-750N, below average bodyweight. Three studies used dynamic loading of custom apparatuses to drive cadaver limbs along predetermined paths to simulate gait. Conversely, the other nine studies applied static loads (∼300N), performed at discreet points during the stance phase, considerably lower than physiological conditions. The present systematic review calls for an urgent need to establish a consensus for preclinical evaluation of TARs for biomechanical function.||||Copyright © 2018 European Foot and Ankle Society.

A systematic review.|['Complications', 'Negative factors', 'Outcomes', 'Positive factors', 'Radiographic findings', 'TAA', 'Total ankle arthroplasty']|Foot and ankle surgery : official journal of the European Society of Foot and Ankle Surgeons|"Patient selection, surgeon's experience and implant design play an integral role and affect the treatment outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). The aims of this study were to investigate the positive and negative attributes that correlate with different clinical and radiographic outcomes.
Eight-nine studies matched the inclusion criteria: (1) studies of primary TAA with uncemented prosthesis; (2) mean follow-up of no less than 2-year; (3) reports of clinical and radiographic outcomes, and exclusion criteria: (1) non-English study; (2) more than one type of prosthesis without separated data; (3) kin studies with shorter follow-up or smaller cohort. Age, etiology, preoperative deformity, surgeon's experience, follow-up duration and prosthetic type were studied with respect to different outcomes by mixed-effects logistic regression analysis.
Patients factor: older patients reported less pain or stiffness and demonstrated less radiographic loosening which did not require additional surgical intervention. More traumatic arthritis experienced adjacent joints degeneration after TAA. Surgeon factor: less experienced surgeons had more intraoperative complications. Lack of experience for complications management without implant retrieval during early period might result in more revisions or fusion was done. Prosthetic factor: updated instrumentation decreased malalignment. If the polyethylene (PE) insert was significantly narrower than the metal components more implant instability and subsequent severe particulate wear was seen. Designs with flat-on-flat articulation and ridge at the center of the talar component associated with more PE fracture. Minimal bone resection reduced postoperative fractures. A flat cut of the tibial component and a flat undersurface with press-fit by two screws or pegs of the talar component demonstrated less postoperative fractures, whereas a syndesmosis fusion and a small triangular shape with one central fin of the talar component experienced more loosening which did not require additional surgery. Anatomic conical shape of the talar component seemed to reduce adjacent joint degeneration. Finally, fewer failures were found in patients who received HINTEGRA and Salto Talaris.

The amniotic membrane-umbilical cord (AM-UC) allograft is a regenerative orthobiologic adjunct that modulates wound healing by down-regulating inflammation, enhancing local healing and antimicrobial factors, and reducing scar formation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether local application of a cryopreserved AM-UC allograft enhances soft tissue healing after TAA. A total of 104 patients with symptomatic ankle arthritis who failed conservative management underwent standard TAA. At skin closure, patients were allocated to either the treatment (local application of AM-UC) or control (no allograft) group. Demographic data, patient comorbidities, and radiographic findings were collected. The primary outcome was a major complication necessitating reoperation. Secondary outcomes were time to healing, minor complications (i.e., skin dehiscence, local wound care, use of antibiotics), and patient scar assessment. Local application of an AM-UC allograft significantly decreased the overall time to skin healing (28.5 days vs 40 days; p = .03). Two patients required a reoperation for soft tissue wound complications, with no difference (p = 1.00) between the groups. No statistically significant difference was detected in terms of skin dehiscence, local wound care, or antibiotic prescriptions in the 2 groups. Regenerative technology using local application of a cryopreserved AM-UC allograft may enhance TAA outcomes by decreasing the time to healing. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether an AM-UC allograft enhances soft tissue wound healing and ultimately reduces the incidence of devastating soft tissue complications.||||Copyright © 2018.

Our experience of treatment of a 30-year-old male suffering from traumatic loss of the whole talus with the insertion of an anatomical antibiotic-loaded talus cement spacer using 3-dimensional printing techniques as an interim measure was reviewed and reported. A young motorcyclist was brought to the emergency department after a road traffic accident. He sustained multiple injuries including traumatic loss of his left talus. Despite repeated surgeries of debridement and insertion of external fixator to his injured ankle, the patient had residual problem of ankle instability, ankle infection, and absence of his involved talus. With the help of computerized 3-dimensional printing techniques, an anatomical talus cement spacer was produced in the operating room and inserted into the patient's ankle 7 weeks after the initial trauma. The external fixator was kept for another 3 weeks before removal. At 14 months after the insertion of cement spacer, the patient could walk independently without any pain for 15 minutes with the help of a crutch occasionally. However, the range of motion of his left ankle was limited to 15° in the flexion-extension arc and minimal subtalar motion. The infection of the left ankle was under control.||||Copyright © 2018.

With recent additive-manufacturing, that is, 3D-printing, custom-made prosthesis can be created by laser-melting metal powders layer-by-layer. Ankle replacement is particularly suitable for this progress because of the limited number of sizes and the poor bone stock. In this study a novel procedure is presented for subject-specific ankle replacements, including medical-imaging, joint modelling, prosthesis design, and 3D-printing. Three shank-foot specimens were CT-scanned, and corresponding 3D bone models of the tibia, fibula, talus, and calcaneus were obtained. From these models, specimen-specific implant sets were designed according to three different concepts, and 3D-printed from cobalt-chromium-molybdenum powder. Accuracy of the overall procedure was assessed via distance map comparisons between original anatomical and final metal implants. Restoration of natural ankle joint mechanics was check after implantation of each of the three sets. In a special rig, a manually-driven dorsi/plantar-flexion was applied throughout the passive arc. Additionally, at three different joint positions, joint torques were imposed in the frontal and axial anatomical planes. Mean manufacturing errors were found to be smaller than 0.08 mm. Consistent motion patterns were observed over repetitions, with the mean standard deviation smaller than 1.0 degree. In each ankle specimen, mobility, and stability at the replaced joints compared well with the original natural condition. For the first time, custom-made implants for total ankle replacements were designed, manufactured with additive technology and tested. This procedure is a first fundamental step toward the development of completely personalized prostheses. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

One treatment is total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), however, its effects on balance are not well understood. This study analyzed balance over a two-year period following TAA. 408 subjects (177 left, 231 right ankles) diagnosed with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis performed quiet standing trials while center of pressure (COP) data were collected. Data were compared across three time points (pre-op, 1-year, and 2-years post-op) and between surgical and non-surgical limbs using a linear mixed model with significance set at P = 0.05. COP excursions in the feet-together condition were not significantly different between limbs after 2 years in anteroposterior or mediolateral directions (P = 0.06, 0.08) after being significantly different between limbs in the anteroposterior (P = 0.014) and mediolateral direction (P < 0.001) pre-op. The vertical ground reaction force significantly decreased across time in the non-surgical limb, while reciprocally increasing in the surgical limb (P < 0.001). After 2 years, no significant difference in vertical ground reaction force between limbs existed (P = 0.20). Limb asymmetry indices decreased at each time point in both conditions (all P < 0.001) and were not significantly different from zero after 2 years in the feet-together condition (P = 0.290). In conclusion, surgical limb balance improved compared to pre-op, resulting in increased symmetry between limbs after 2 years. Vertical ground reaction forces on both limbs converge and limb asymmetry indices approach zero two years post-op. Differences in the COP excursion-loading symmetry relationship between limbs could be useful for identifying instability in other pathologies.||||Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a report of clinical follow-up data of a prospective, consecutive cohort of patients who underwent TAA by a single surgeon from 1999 to 2013 with the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) prosthesis.
Patients undergoing TAA at a single US institution were enrolled into a prospective study. These patients were followed at regular intervals with history, physical examination, and radiographs; American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale scores were obtained and recorded. Primary outcomes included implant survivability and functional outcomes scores. Secondary outcomes included perioperative complications such as periprosthetic or polyethylene fracture. Between 1999 and 2013, a total of 138 STAR TAAs were performed in 131 patients; 81 patients were female. The mean age at surgery was 61.5 ± 12.3 years (range, 30-88 years). The mean duration of follow-up for living patients who retained both initial components at final follow-up was 8.8±4.3 years (range 2-16.9 years).
The mean change in AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot scores from preoperative to final follow-up was 36.0 ± 16.8 ( P < .0001). There were 21 (15.2%) implant failures that occurred at a mean 4.9 ± 4.5 years postoperation. Ten polyethylene components in 9 TAAs (6.5%) required replacement for fracture at an average 8.9 ± 3.3 years postoperatively. Fourteen patients died with their initial implants in place.
This cohort of patients with true intermediate follow-up after TAA with the STAR prosthesis had acceptable implant survival, maintenance of improved patient-reported outcome scores, and low major complication rates.

Current recommendations are based on patients with total hip and total knee arthroplasties. We investigated available evidence regarding the need for dental antibiotic prophylaxis in patients post foot and ankle surgery, specifically total ankle arthroplasty. Additionally, we examined the microbiology behind the risk of transient bacteremia from dental procedures and whether this leads to an increased risk for postoperative infection in foot and ankle surgery.
We performed a MEDLINE literature review of English articles between 1980 and 2018 on patients with prosthetic joints undergoing dental work, and studies evaluating hematogenous prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and dental antibiotic prophylaxis. We additionally included articles on PJI post total ankle arthroplasty, as well as committee guidelines.
There is no literature at present that evaluates transient bacteremia with dental procedures in patients following foot and ankle surgery. The data on this topic are isolated to PJI rates in the context of hip and total knee arthroplasty. This is of particular interest as rates of total ankle arthroplasty PJI have been reported to be 2- to 4-fold higher than in hip and total knee arthroplasty.
The concern for postoperative infection due to transient bacteremia without dental antibiotic prophylaxis can be extrapolated to patients undergoing foot and ankle surgeries. Some data suggest that oral cavity bacteria can seed a prosthetic joint, though no clear relationship has been demonstrated. Similar risk factors have been identified between hip and knee PJI and total ankle arthroplasty. In light of the absence of scrutiny of and guidelines on this topic in foot and ankle surgery, it may be advisable to apply similar principles to decision-making in patients after foot and ankle surgery.

Weight-bearing (WB) radiographs are the standard for evaluating the sagittal balance alignment, but are prone to rotational misalignment and altered measurements. Metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) MRI allows visualization of periprosthetic landmarks and alignment of the image plane to the true sagittal axis of the implant. The purpose of this study was to compare TAR sagittal balance measurements on MARS MRI and WB radiographs.
Twenty-three subjects with TAR [10 men/13 women, age 60 (41-73) years; 13 (3-24) months post-op] underwent MARS MRI and standard lateral WB radiographs. Standardized MARS MR images were aligned to the sagittal talar component axis. Three observers performed sagittal balance alignment measurements twice in an independent, random and blinded fashion. Lateral Talar Station (LTS), tibial axis-to-talus (T-T) ratio and normalized tibial axis-to-lateral-process (T-L) distance were measured. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used for statistical analysis. In addition, mixed effects linear models were employed to assess overall concordance of the two image types.
The intraobserver agreement was excellent for radiographic (CCC=0.96) and MRI (CCC=0.90-0.97) measurements. Interobserver agreements were good-to-excellent with overall slightly higher agreements for MRI (ICC=0.78-0.94) than radiography (ICC=0.78-0.90) measurements. The T-T ratios of radiographs and MRI showed a high degree of concordance, whereas LTS was significantly lower on MRI when compared with radiographs, and T-L distance showed notable disagreement between the two imaging types.
Sagittal balance measurements performed on standardized weight-bearing radiographs and standardized MARS MRI demonstrate substantial correlation and similarity. Given its high intra and interobserver agreement, MARS MRI may be helpful for the evaluation of TAR sagittal balance.

Associated hindfoot arthrodesis procedures are at times needed to correct malalignment or to address adjacent joint arthritis. Results following TAA and associated hindfoot arthrodesis have at times been underwhelming and the devascularization of the talar blood supply has been postulated as a potential cause. This study explored the association between hindfoot arthrodesis fixation and talar component subsidence.
The study included 81 consecutive patients who underwent a TAA with either an isolated subtalar arthrodesis or combined subtalar and talonavicular arthrodesis with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. Radiographic and clinical evaluations including patient-reported outcomes were performed at each postoperative visit. The primary outcome measure was the presence of talar component subsidence while patient-reported outcomes were the secondary outcome measure.
30.9% of patients had evidence of talar component subsidence. Subsidence was seen in 55.5% of patients with dorsal to plantar subtalar fixation compared to 11.1% of patients with plantar to dorsal screws ( P < .001) and in 44.4% of patients with screws violating the sinus tarsi compared to 3.7% of patients without screws in the sinus tarsi ( P < .001). Screws that were placed from dorsal to plantar were more likely to violate the sinus tarsi ( P < .001). Patients with evidence of talar subsidence reported higher pain scores and lower functional scores. There were 8 TAA failures, and the presence of dorsal to plantar screws was associated with failure ( P < .01).
Screws that are placed across the subtalar joint from a dorsal to plantar approach are more likely to violate the sinus tarsi, contributing to a significantly higher rate of talar component subsidence when associated with TAA.

With proper ankle balancing, a well-aligned ankle implant can be maintained over time and provide successful patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate radiographic and subjective outcomes in patients with ankle arthritis along with coronal plane deformity who underwent total ankle arthroplasty with a 3-piece mobile-bearing implant. Our primary inclusion criterion was patients who demonstrated more than 5° of tibiotalar coronal deformity in either varus or valgus direction. Sixty-three consecutive patients who underwent total ankle replacement were reviewed. Of these, 25 (39.7%) met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen (64%) patients had a varus deformity (Group 1) and 9 (36%) had valgus deformity (Group 2) preoperatively. Alignment was evaluated radiographically at 5 different intervals: preoperative, immediate postoperative, and 6, 12, and 36 months postoperative. In patients with varus deformity, the mean tibiotalar angle was 12.6°, 0.8°, 1.0°,1.0°, and 0.8° for preoperative, immediate postoperative, and 6, 12, and 36 months, respectively. The same measurements and intervals for patients with valgus deformity were found to be 10.3°, 1.4°, 1.6°, 1.4°, and 1.4°. A statistically significant difference was observed in preoperative and postoperative coronal plane deformity. This correction was maintained at final follow-up visit. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scores and visual analogue scale scores were recorded as well, and statistically significant improvements in preoperative and postoperative scores were found (p < .001). In conclusion, coronal plane deformity correction of the ankle can be accomplished and maintained in total ankle replacement procedures with proper soft tissue balancing and osseous procedures as indicated.||||Copyright © 2018 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

In this study, we aimed to use a large total ankle database to identify independent risk factors for implant failure at mid- to long-term follow-up.
A prospectively collected database was used to identify all patients who underwent primary TAA with a minimum 5 years' follow-up. The primary outcome was revision, defined as removal of one or both metal components; failures due to infection were excluded. Patient and clinical factors analyzed included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, presence of diabetes, indication for TAA, implant, tourniquet time, and presence of ipsilateral hindfoot fusion. Preoperative coronal deformity and sagittal talar translation were assessed, as were postoperative coronal and sagittal tibial component alignment. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors of implant failure. After excluding 5 ankles that failed because of deep infection, 533 ankles with a mean 7 (range, 5-11) years of follow-up met the inclusion criteria. Four implants were used: INBONE I, INBONE II, STAR, and Salto-Talaris.
Thirty-four ankles (6.4%) were revised or removed a mean 4 (range, 1-9) years postoperatively. The only independent predictors of failure were the INBONE I prosthesis and ipsilateral hindfoot fusion ( P = .006 and P = .023, respectively).
This is among the largest studies to analyze the relationship between TAA failure rates and multiple different patient, operative, and radiographic factors. Of note, age, BMI, and amount of deformity were not associated with higher failure rates. Only patients with ipsilateral hindfoot fusion or who received the INBONE I prosthesis were at significantly higher risk of implant failure.

Patients were included if they met CJR criteria for inclusion into the bundled payment model. All Medicare payments beginning at the index procedure through 90 days postoperatively were identified. Patient, operative, and postoperative characteristics were associated with costs in adjusted, multivariable analyses. One hundred thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria for the study.
Cerebrovascular disease (intracranial hemorrhages, strokes, or transient ischemic attacks) was initially associated with increased costs (mean, $5595.25; 95% CI, $1710.22-$9480.28) in adjusted analyses ( P = .005), though this variable did not meet a significance threshold adjusted for multiple comparisons. Increased length of stay, discharge to a skilled nursing facility (SNF), admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and wound complications were significant postoperative drivers of payment.
Common comorbidities did not reliably predict increased costs. Increased length of stay, discharge to an SNF, readmission, ED visits, and wound complications were postoperative factors that considerably increased costs. Lastly, reducing the rates of SNF placement, readmission, ED visitation, and wound complications are targets for reducing costs for patients undergoing TAA.

A total of 81 patients (81 ankles) were included in the study and divided in two groups. Group A, ""varus"" group, includes 11 patients with pre-operative varus deformity of more than 10 ° and group B, ""neutral"" group, includes 70 patients, with a varus/valgus deformity of less than 10 °. American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, visual analogue scale (VAS), and Short Form (SF)-12 score were used to compare clinical outcomes. Radiological parameters, complications, and survival rate at last follow-up were also recorded.
In both groups, all clinical and radiological parameters improved after surgery (p < 0.05) without statistically significant difference. Complications were similar between two groups. Overall in three cases, an implant revision was necessary: 1 in group A (9%) at 3.1 years follow-up and 2 (3%) in group B at 3.8 years, without statistically significant difference (p > 0.001).
Severe varus malalignment should not be considered a contraindication for a mobile-bearing TAR.

The primary goal of this study was to compare the use of PSI with the standard referencing guide (SRG) in regards to accuracy of tibial implant positioning. Operative time, fluoroscopy time and accuracy of PSI preoperative reports were also evaluated.
A retrospective analysis of 99 patients who underwent a primary TAA with the INFINITY prosthesis (Wright Medical, Memphis, TN) was performed. Patients were divided in two groups based on the type of instrumentation used during the TAA (75 in the PSI group vs 24 in the SRG group). There was no significant difference between groups in regards to age at the time of surgery (P=0.122), sex (P=0.138), number of concomitant procedures performed during surgery (P=0.567) and etiology (P=0.841). However, preoperative deformity was significantly smaller in the PSI group (P=0.002).
Tibial implant positioning was similar between groups. In the coronal plane, the absolute deviation of the tibial implant from the intended alignment was 1.7±1.4° for the SRG and 1.6±1.2° for PSI (P=0.710). In the sagittal plane, the absolute alignment deviation of the tibial implant was 1.8±1.4° for the SRG and 1.9±1.5° for PSI (P=0.675). Operative time (167 vs 190min, P=0.040) and fluoroscopy time (85 vs 158s, P<0.001) were significantly decreased in the PSI group. The PSI preoperative plan report correctly predicted the implant size in 73% of cases for the tibial component and in 51% of cases for the talar component.
PSI provided similar tibial component alignment as standard instrumentation. Additionally, PSI preoperative plan reports were poor predictors of implant sizing. Therefore, the final decision should always be based on surgeon's experience in order to prevent errors in implant sizing and positioning.

Scientific publications extracted from national joint registers for total ankle replacement provide useful but heterogeneous information on implants survivorship, implant models and risk factors. There is still a discrepancy between the data reported by designers in clinical studies and the data reported by the registries.

It is therefore important to have a reliable fall-back option in case of failed TAR. Revision arthroplasty is often impossible because of loss of bonestock or infection. Conversion to ankle fusion is then indicated. We investigated the clinical, radiographic and patient reported results for fusion after failed TAR in a consecutive group of patients. We concentrated on the influence of inflammatory joint disease (IJD) on union rate.
Patient files and radiographic images of 46 consecutive patients (47 ankles) were reviewed. There were 22 patients with IJD. Fixation methods included; anterior plating, blade plate fixation, intramedullary nailing, compression screws and external fixation. Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) were used to determine patient related outcomes.
Forty out of 47 ankles (85%) Fused. Union rate in the non-IJD group (96%) was significantly higher compared to the IJD-group (73%, p=0.04). Revisions and complications were more frequent in the IJD group, but numbers were too small to detect a significant difference. Mean PROM scores were: FAOS-symptoms; 68.5, FAOS-pain; 70.3, FAOS-QoL; 43.7, FAOS-ADL; 68.1 and FAAM-ADL; 52.1, with no significant difference between IJD and non-IJD patients.

One treatment option for these patients is total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). This procedure has historically been performed in the inpatient setting with a 1-2-night postoperative hospital stay. Outpatient surgeries are gaining popularity due to their cost effectiveness, decreased length of hospital stay, and convenience. Therefore it is important to evaluate the safety of specific procedures in the outpatient setting compared with the inpatient setting. This study evaluated the complication rates in inpatient versus outpatient TAA. It analyzed data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program for 591 patients who received TAA. Postoperative complication rates were compared between 66 outpatients and 535 inpatients. Frequencies of the following complications were analyzed: wound complications, pneumonia, hematologic complications (pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis), renal failure, stroke, and return to the operating room within 30 days. Unadjusted direct comparisons of the cohorts revealed higher complication rates in the inpatient cohort. Inpatients had higher rates of superficial surgical site infections, deep surgical site infections, number of organ/space surgical site infections, pneumonia occurrences, and return to the operating room, but these differences were not significant. These results showed no significant increase in complication rates in outpatients compared to inpatients. Our results suggest that inpatient and outpatient TAA show similar complication rates. This suggests that outpatient TAA is safe and may be a superior option for certain populations. Further investigation is warranted to verify these conclusions.||||Copyright © 2018 the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

302|30296848|Analysis of Failed Ankle Arthroplasty Components.|['polyethylene oxidation', 'retrieval analysis', 'total ankle prostheses']|Foot & ankle international|"Although advances in joint-replacement technology have made total ankle arthroplasty a viable treatment for end-stage arthritis, revision rates for ankle replacements are higher than in hip or knee replacements. The questions asked in this study were what can retrieved ankle devices demonstrate about ankle arthroplasty failures and how can understanding the causes of these failures inform clinical decisions for current and future ankle arthroplasty patients?
An IRB-approved retrieval laboratory received retrieved components and surgeon-supplied reason for revision from 70 total-ankles (7 designs, including 5 currently marketed designs) from 2002 to 2018. These retrievals were rated for clinical wear and damage. Metal components were rated by method and effectiveness of fixation. Polyethylene inserts received by the laboratory 6 months or less after retrieval (n = 45) were analyzed for oxidation using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS, version 22.
The ankle implants were retrieved most commonly for loosening and polyethylene fracture. Loosening occurred more frequently in fixed-bearing designs (n = 18) than in the mobile-bearing designs (n = 4) and after shorter in vivo time (mean in vivo time to retrieval for loosening: fixed bearing 3.2 ± 2.1 years, mobile bearing 9.7 ± 4.5 years). Gamma-sterilized ankle inserts oxidized at a higher rate than non-gamma (EtO or gas-plasma) sterilized ankle inserts (gamma 0.29 ± 0.22/y, non-gamma 0.07 ± 0.05/y, mean difference=0.215, 95% CI 0.128-0.303, P < .001). The presence of clinical fatigue (cracking and/or delamination) of the polyethylene insert correlated with measured oxidation (Spearman rho = 0.685, P < .001). Nine inserts, all gamma-sterilized, fractured in vivo.
This study suggests that loosening could be more of a problem in fixed-bearing devices than in mobile bearing devices. Gamma-sterilized polyethylene inserts were found to suffer fatigue damage or fracture in vivo, resulting in the need for revision. Retrieval analysis can provide insight into implant-related reasons for revision, with the goal of understanding the implant-related causes of these failures, informing future ankle design and clinical decisions for current and future ankle arthroplasty patients.

The literature lacks consistency in reporting adverse events and complications. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive analysis of each of these complications from a literature review, and to compare them with rates from our Unit, to aid clinicians with the process of informed consent.
A total of 278 consecutive total ankle arthroplasties (251 patients), performed by four surgeons over a six-year period in Wrightington Hospital (Wigan, United Kingdom) were prospectively reviewed. There were 143 men and 108 women with a mean age of 64 years (41 to 86). The data were recorded on each follow-up visit. Any complications either during initial hospital stay or subsequently reported on follow-ups were recorded, investigated, monitored, and treated as warranted. Literature search included the studies reporting the outcomes and complications of TAA implants.

Currently, the course of deterioration in pain and physical functioning in individuals with osteoarthritis is difficult to predict. Factors such as socioeconomic status and comorbidity contribute to progression of osteoarthritis, but clear associations have not been established. There is a need for early identification of individuals with slow disease development and a good prognosis, and those that should be recommended for future joint replacement surgery.
This nationwide register-based study will use data for approximately 75 000 patients who sought and received core treatment for osteoarthritis in primary healthcare, and were registered in the Swedish population-based National Quality Register for Better Management of Patients with Osteoarthritis. These data will be merged with data for replacement surgery, socioeconomic factors, healthcare consumption and comorbidity from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register, the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register, Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden. The linkage will be performed using personal identity numbers that are unique to all citizens in Sweden.
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg, Sweden (dnr 1059-16). The results from this study will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and reported at suitable national and international meetings.

BMD can be estimated by measuring Hounsfield units (HU) on standard computed tomography (CT), which is frequently performed prior to TAA. We aimed to identify whether tibial and talar HU measured from preoperative CT scans were associated with periprosthetic fracture or revision risk in patients undergoing TAA.
A prospectively collected database was used to retrospectively screen all patients undergoing primary TAA. Only patients with a preoperative CT within 1 year of surgery were included. Primary outcomes were periprosthetic fracture and prosthetic revision. HU were measured on axial CT cuts in the distal tibia and talus. Additional patient factors analyzed included age, sex, weight, body mass index (BMI), tobacco use, presence of rheumatoid arthritis, and preoperative deformity. A total of 198 ankles were included, with a mean 2.4 years of follow-up.
There were 7 intraoperative and 9 postoperative periprosthetic fractures (3.5% and 4.5%, respectively). Seven patients (3.5%) underwent prosthetic removal or revision. Lower tibial and talar HU, lower weight, and lower BMI were associated with periprosthetic fractures ( P < .05). After controlling for age, sex, and weight, only tibial HU was significantly associated with periprosthetic fracture ( P = .018). All intraoperative fractures occurred in patients with tibial HU less than 200. None of the patient factors analyzed were associated with revision.
Lower tibial HU on preoperative CT was strongly associated with periprosthetic fracture risk with TAA. In patients with tibial HU less than 200, surgeons may consider prophylactic internal fixation of the medial malleolus.

However, sensorimotor impairments are observed in ankle flexors/extensors muscles after rehabilitation, with potential negative effects on locomotion. Here we determined the timing and amplitude of co-activation of the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles during gait by assessing non-operated and operated legs of patients with total ankle replacement, 5 years after surgery.
Twenty-nine patients (age: 58 [5.5] years, height: 156.4 [6.5] cm, body mass: 72.9 [6.5] kg, 10 men, and 19 women) that underwent Hintegra® ankle arthroplasty were included. Inclusion criteria included 5 years prosthesis survivorship. The onset and offset of muscle activation (timing), as well as the amplitude of activation, were determined during barefoot walking at self-selected speed by surface electromyography. The timing, percentage, and index of co-activation between the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius were quantified and compared between non-operated and operated legs.
The operated leg showed higher co-activation index and temporal overlapping between tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius during gait (p < 0.001).
The neuromuscular changes developed during the process of degeneration do not appear to be restored 5 years following arthroplasty. The insertion of an ankle implant may restore anatomy and alignment but neuromuscular adaptations to degeneration are not corrected by 5 years following joint replacement."||||Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

With recent advances in surgical instrumentation and techniques, prosthetic replacement of the ankle has proven to be a valid alternative to arthrodesis with comparable outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiological findings in a transfibular total ankle replacement with follow-up of at least 2 years.
This prospective study included 89 patients who underwent transfibular total ankle arthroplasty from May 2013 to February 2016. The mean age was 53.2 ± 13.5 years. All patients were followed for at least 24 months postoperatively with an average follow-up of 42.0 ± 23.5 months. Patients were assessed clinically and radiographically preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively.
At 24 months postoperatively, patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle Hindfoot Score from 33.8 ± 14.3 to 88.5 ± 6.6 ( P < .001), visual analog scale (VAS) from 80.5 ± 17.0 to 14.1 ± 9.2 ( P < .001), and Short Form-12 Physical and Mental Composite Scores from 29.9 ± 6.7 and 43.3 ± 8.6 to 47.0 ± 7.6 and 53.3 ± 8.1, respectively ( P < .001). In addition, ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion improved from 6.2 ± 5.5 and 9.6 ± 5.8 degrees to 24.2 ± 7.9 and 18.1 ± 7.6 degrees, respectively ( P < .001). Radiographically, patients demonstrated maintained neutral alignment of the ankle at 24 months. No patient demonstrated any radiographic evidence of tibial or talar lucency at final follow-up. Seven patients underwent reoperation for removal of symptomatic hardware (6 fibular plates, 1 syndesmotic screw); 2 patients experienced delayed wound healing. The first one was treated with plate removal and flap coverage. The second one required fibular plate removal. One patient developed a postoperative prosthetic infection requiring operative debridement, removal of implants, and placement of an antibiotic spacer.
This study found that transfibular total ankle replacement was a safe and effective option for patients with ankle arthritis resulting in improvements in patient-reported outcomes, range of motion, and radiographic parameters. However, further studies are required to determine the mid- and long-term performance of these implants.

We hypothesized that patients who had received intraoperative TXA during total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) would have a reduction in postoperative drain output, thereby resulting in a reduced risk of postoperative hemarthrosis and lower wound complication rates. A retrospective review was conducted on 50 consecutive patients, 25 receiving TXA (TXA-TAA) and 25 not receiving TXA (No TXA-TAA), who underwent an uncemented TAA between September 2011 and December 2015. Demographic characteristics, drain output, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels, operative and postoperative course, and minor and major wound complications of the patients were reviewed. Drain output was significantly less in the TXA-TAA group compared to that in the No TXA-TAA group (71.6 ± 60.3 vs 200.2 ± 117.0 mL, respectively, P < .0001). The overall wound complication rate in the No TXA-TAA group was higher (20%, 5/25) than that in the TXA-TAA group (8%, 2/25) (P = .114). The mean change in preoperative to postoperative hemoglobin level was significantly less in the TXA-TAA group compared to that in the No TXA-TAA group (1.5 ± 0.6 vs 2.0 ± 0.4 g/dL, respectively, P = .01). TXA is an effective hemostatic agent when used during TAA.

American volume|"Many studies of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) have focused on the range of motion and functional outcomes at the time of intermediate-term follow-up. The purpose of our study was to analyze the progression of ankle hindfoot range of motion and patient-reported measures through the first 2 years following TAA.
The charts of 134 patients who had been treated with a TAA by a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed, and 107 (109 TAAs) were included in the study. The overall range of motion in the sagittal plane was measured as the change in the position of the tibia relative to the floor on dedicated weight-bearing lateral radiographs made with the ankle in maximum plantar flexion and dorsiflexion preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. In addition, patients completed a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Sports Subscales, and the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Summary scores at each time interval.
The mean overall range of motion in the sagittal plane was 20.7° preoperatively and improved to 28.3°, 34.3°, 33.3°, and 33.3° at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively (p < 0.001). At each postoperative time point, the median VAS score was improved (p < 0.001) compared with the preoperative VAS score. Similarly, the FAAM and SF-12 scores were improved, compared with the preoperative score, at 6 months and later (p < 0.001). An increased range of motion correlated with a lower VAS score preoperatively (ρ = -0.31, p = 0.035) and at 1 year (ρ = -0.36, p = 0.003) postoperatively. An increased range of motion correlated with a higher FAAM ADL score at 3 months (ρ = 0.50, p = 0.012), 1 year (ρ = 0.26, p = 0.040), and 2 years (ρ = 0.39, p = 0.003) postoperatively.
Patients who underwent TAA had improvement, compared with preoperatively, in the overall sagittal plane range of motion up to 6 months and maintained improvement in pain and function scores up to 2 years. Pain scores remained improved throughout the 2-year follow-up period. A better range of motion was correlated with less pain as measured with the VAS. An increased range of motion postoperatively was correlated with better function as measured with the FAAM.

Our aim was to identify the rate of early revision among patients receiving the 2-component INFINITY prosthesis.
Patients from 2 prospectively collected databases at the authors' institution were screened for inclusion in the present study. All patients who underwent a primary total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) with the INFINITY prosthesis and who were at least 1 year postoperative were included. A total of 159 ankles with a mean 20 months of follow up (range, 12-37) met these criteria. All surgeries were performed by 1 of 2 orthopedic foot and ankle surgeons with extensive experience in TAA. The primary outcome was the need for revision surgery, defined as removal of 1 or both metal components. Peri-implant lucency at most recent follow-up was a secondary outcome. Weightbearing radiographs at most recent follow-up were graded for lucency independently by 2 reviewers.
Sixteen ankles (10%) underwent revision at a mean 13 months postoperatively. The most common reasons for revision were symptomatic tibial component loosening and deep infection (6 patients each, 3.8%). Of the 108 ankles with retained components and at least 1 year of radiographic follow-up, 8 (7.4%) had global lucency around the tibial component suggestive of loosening at most recent follow-up.
Our initial review of patients undergoing TAA with this new 2-component prosthesis demonstrates an elevated early revision rate due to tibial component loosening compared to other implant systems.

Over the past decade, TAR instrumentation, techniques, and implants have improved, making the procedure more reliable and reproducible, thus making TAR more common.
The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2007 to 2013 was used to obtain data on patients elder than 50 years who underwent either TAR or TTA. Differences in temporal, demographic, and diagnosis trends between TAR and TTA were analyzed.
Between 2007 and 2013, 15,060 patients underwent TAR and 35,096 underwent TTA. Patients undergoing TTA had significantly more comorbidities (2.17 versus 1.55; P < 0.001). The share of TAR performed increased significantly from 2007 (14%) to 2013 (45%) (P < 0.001). From 2007 to 2013, we found a 12-fold increase in the odds of having a TAR for patients with posttraumatic osteoarthritis (P < 0.001), a 4.9-fold increase for those with primary osteoarthritis, and a 3.1-fold increase for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (P < 0.001).
Over the past decade, the frequency of TAR has increased, particularly in patients with posttraumatic arthritis and osteoarthritis. Surgeons still perform TAR in healthier patients compared with TTA; however, because surgeons become more experienced with the technique, patients are undergoing TAR at a markedly higher rate.

Revision TAA surgery has become more common with availability of revision implants and refinement of bone-conserving primary implants. In this study, patient-reported results and clinical outcomes were analyzed for a cohort of patients who underwent both primary and revision TAA at a single high-volume institution.
We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data on 29 patients with failed primary total ankle arthroplasty. Cases of isolated polyethylene exchange, infection, or extra-articular realignment procedures were excluded. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures and clinical results were reviewed in this longitudinal study.
Fifteen patients (51.7%) underwent revision of just the talar and polyethylene components while 13 patients (44.8%) underwent revision of all components. The most common cause was talar subsidence (51.7%). The average time to revision was 3.9 years with a follow-up of 3.2 years after revision, and 3 (10.3%) revision arthroplasties required further surgery; 2 required conversion to arthrodesis and 1 required second revision TAA. Improvements in PROs were better after primary than revision TAA.
Clinical and patient-reported results of revision ankle arthroplasty after metal component failure improved significantly but never reached the improvements seen after primary ankle arthroplasty. In our series, 10.3% of revision TAAs required a second revision TAA or arthrodesis surgery.

American volume|"The Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model provides bundled payments for in-hospital care and care within 90 days following discharge for Medicare beneficiaries undergoing lower-extremity joint replacement involving the hip, knee, or ankle (total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or total ankle arthroplasty [TAA]). The study hypothesis was that patient comorbidities are associated with readmissions, emergency department (ED) utilization, and subspecialist wound-healing consultation, which are examples of costly contributors to postoperative health-care spending.
The medical records for 1,024 patients undergoing TAAs between June 2007 and December 2016 at a single academic center in the southeastern United States were reviewed for the outcomes of readmissions, ED visitations, and subspecialist wound-healing consultation within the 90-day post-discharge period. All patients undergoing TAA (n = 1,365) were eligible. Of the 1,037 patients who consented to participation in the study and underwent TAA, 1,024 (98.7%) completed the study. Medical comorbidities according to the Elixhauser and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity indices that were present prior to TAA were recorded. Univariate and multivariable tests of significance were used to relate patient and operative characteristics to outcomes.
Four hundred and ninety-six (48.4%) of the 1,024 patients were female, and 964 (94.1%) were white/Caucasian, with an average age (and standard deviation) of 63 ± 10.5 years. Hypertension, obesity, solid tumor, depression, rheumatic disease, cardiac arrhythmia, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and chronic pulmonary disease had a prevalence of >10%. Fifty-three (5.2%) of the 1,024 patients were readmitted for any cause. Thirty-six (3.5%) of the 1,024 returned to the ED but were not admitted to the hospital. Readmission or ED visitation was most commonly for a wound complication, followed by deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) evaluation, while urgent medical evaluations composed the majority of non-TAA-related ED visitations. No patient comorbidities were significantly associated with 90-day readmission, ED visitation, or wound complications in multivariable models.
Patient comorbidities were not associated with 90-day hospital readmissions or ED visitation for patients undergoing TAA. Readmissions were dominated by evaluation of wound compromise as well as DVT and PE. These data suggest that there may be considerable differences between TAA and total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty that cause surgeons to question the inclusion of TAA in CJR bundled payment models.

The total cohort was divided into 2 groups based on insert size. Group 1 included patients with polyethylene insert size less than 10 mm in thickness. Group 2 included patients with polyethylene insert sizes 10 mm and larger. Available charts were reviewed for patients who underwent primary total ankle arthroplasty by one surgeon. Patient demographics, polyethylene insert size, implant used, concomitant procedures, postoperative complications, and patient-reported outcome scores were recorded. One hundred patients were available for follow-up and were included in this study, which ranged from March 2012 to July 2017. The average follow-up was 31.3 months (range = 10-60 months). Forty-eight females and 52 males were included in this study. There were a total of 63 patients in group 1 and 47 patients in group 2. The total complication rate for patients in group 1 was 11.1% (7/63), and in group 2 it was 16.2% (6/32). There was no statistical significance in complication rates when comparing the 2 groups (P = 0.5427). All patients underwent at least one concomitant procedure at the time of initial ankle replacement. Our findings show that total ankle replacement complication rates are equal when comparing large polyethylene inserts commonly utilized to correct deformities, versus small polyethylene inserts commonly utilized in primary resurfacing. |||||10.1177/1938640018787044|2018-07-28|[{'lastname': 'Cottom', 'firstname': 'James M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Florida Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Center, Sarasota, Florida (JMC, SMD, KKM).\nLongview Orthopedic Clinic Association, Longview, Texas (BSP).'}, {'lastname': 'Douthett', 'firstname': 'Steven M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Florida Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Center, Sarasota, Florida (JMC, SMD, KKM).\nLongview Orthopedic Clinic Association, Longview, Texas (BSP).'}, {'lastname': 'McConnell', 'firstname': 'Kelly K', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': 'Florida Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Center, Sarasota, Florida (JMC, SMD, KKM).\nLongview Orthopedic Clinic Association, Longview, Texas (BSP).'}, {'lastname': 'Plemmons', 'firstname': 'Britton S', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': 'Florida Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Center, Sarasota, Florida (JMC, SMD, KKM).\nLongview Orthopedic Clinic Association, Longview, Texas (BSP).'}]

However, there are few studies focussing on patient-reported outcomes in the medium and long term related to age or arthritis type. We compared demographic data and patient-reported outcomes preoperatively and at five years postoperatively for patients who underwent total ankle replacement with the aim of establishing whether differences exist in outcome depending on patient age or diagnosis. The Foot and Ankle Score (FAOS) and 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey were analysed by diagnosis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, post-traumatic arthritis) and age (under or over 60 years). At 5 years, the post-traumatic arthritis group had a significantly higher composite score than the osteoarthritis (p<0.0001) or rheumatoid arthritis groups (p<0.0001). Only the post-traumatic arthritis group experienced a significant increase in composite SF-36 score from baseline (p<0.0001). There was a significant improvement from pre-operatively to 5 years in all three domains of the FAOS and in total scores in both groups (over 60 p<0.0001; 60 and under p=0.0002). There was a significant improvement in composite SF-36 score from pre-operative to 5 years in the patients 60 years or younger at the time of surgery (p=0.0006), but not for the patients over 60. Three patients have been revised (4%), at a mean of 4.8 years following surgery with one patient awaiting revision.||||Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the national trends in usage and perioperative outcomes of TAA in the United States. International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9), codes were used to search the National Hospital Discharge Survey database for TAA from 1997 to 2010. Patient demographics, comorbidities, hospitalization length, discharge disposition, blood transfusion, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and mortality data were gathered. Trends were evaluated using linear regression with Pearson's correlation coefficient, and statistical comparisons were performed using Student's t test and z-test for proportions with significance at p = .05. We identified 120 patients with TAA. TAA demonstrated a positive correlation with time (r = 0.57), significantly increasing from 2.4 cases per 100,000 admissions from 1997 to 2003 to 3.5 cases per 100,000 from 2004 to 2010 (p = .04). The mean age was 57.8 (range 19 to 83) years. The mean number of comorbidities was 4.5 (range 1 to ≥7). Although patient age remained stable (p = .21), the mean number of comorbidities significantly increased from 4.0 from 1997 to 2003 to 4.8 from 2004 to 2010 (p = .02); 8 patients (6.7%) had diabetes, 71 (59.2%) had primary osteoarthritis, and 35 (29.2%) had posttraumatic arthropathy. The mean length of stay significantly decreased from 3.1 to 2.3 days (p = .03). Three patients (2.5%) required a blood transfusion. No deep vein thrombosis or PE was diagnosed. No patients died during the operative admission; 95 patients (87%) were discharged home and 14 (13%) required a skilled rehabilitation facility. Discharge patterns showed no significant change with time (p = .59). Usage of TAA in the United States has increased nearly 50% over the past 14 years. TAA was associated with shorter hospitalization, infrequent rehabilitation facility requirements, and few perioperative complications.||||Copyright © 2018 The American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Two fixed-bearing total ankle replacement systems with different types of polyethylene liners were tested: (1) CPE sterilized in ethylene oxide, and (2) HXLPE sterilized with gas plasma after electron beam irradiation. Three implants for each design underwent wear testing using gravimetric analysis over 5 million simulated walking cycles. A fourth implant was used as a load soak control. Equivalent circle diameter (ECD) and equivalent shape ratio (ESR) were computed to determine particle size and particle shape, respectively.
The mean wear rate from 1.5 to 5 million cycles (MC) was 2.0 ± 0.3 mg/MC for HXLPE and 16.7 ± 1.3 mg/MC for CPE ( P < .001). The total number of particles per cycle generated for HXLPE and CPE were 0.17 × 10
HXLPE liners had a significantly lower wear rate and produced significantly fewer and rounder particles than CPE liners. The results of this study suggest that HXLPE has more favorable wear characteristics for total ankle arthroplasty.
Polyethylene wear particles have been linked to osteolysis after total ankle arthroplasty. There is no consensus on the importance of highly cross-linked polyethylene in total ankle arthroplasty with regard to implant wear. This is the first nonindustry study to compare the polyethylene wear rate, particle size, and particle shape of fixed-bearing total ankle arthroplasty conventional polyethylene versus highly cross-linked polyethylene.

Total ankle arthroplasty implants in 6 human cadaver ankles served as surrogates for arthroplasty implants. All specimens underwent computed tomography with a 2 × 192-slice dual-source computed tomography scanner at tube voltages of 80 and tin-filtered 150 kVp to produce mixed 120 kVp equivalent polychromatic and virtual monoenergetic extrapolated images at 150 and 190 keV (VME 150 and VME 190, respectively). By implementing the WFBP and iMAR reconstruction algorithms on polychromatic, VME 150 and VME 190 data, 6 image datasets were created: WFBP-Polychromatic, iMAR-Polychromatic, WFBP-VME 150, WFBP-VME 190, iMAR-VME 150, and iMAR-VME 190. High-density and low-density artifacts were separately quantified with a threshold-based computer algorithm. After anonymization and randomization, 2 observers independently ranked the datasets for overall image quality. Repeated measures analysis of variance, Friedman, and Cohen weighted κ tests were applied for statistical analysis. A conservative P value of less than 0.001 was considered statistically significant.
iMAR-VME 190 keV and iMAR-VME 150 keV created the least amount of high-density artifacts (all P < 0.001), whereas iMAR-Polychromatic was the most effective method to mitigate low-density streaks (P < 0.001). For low- and high-density artifacts, polychromatic iMAR acquisition was superior to WFBP-VME 150 keV and WFBP-VME 190 keV (all P < 0.001). On sharp kernel reconstructions, readers ranked the overall image quality of iMAR-Polychromatic images highest (all P < 0.001). Similarly, on soft tissue kernel reconstructions, readers ranked iMAR-Polychromatic images highest with a statistically significant difference over other techniques (all P < 0.001), except for iMAR-VME 150 keV (P = 0.356).
In computed tomography imaging of ankle arthroplasty implants, iMAR reconstruction results in fewer metal artifacts and better image quality than WFBP reconstruction for both polychromatic and virtual monoenergetic data. The combination of iMAR and VME at higher photon energies results in mixed effects on implant-induced metal artifacts, including decreased high-density and increased low-density artifacts, which in combination does not improve image quality over iMAR reconstruction of the polychromatic data. Our results suggest that, for ankle arthroplasty implants, the highest image quality is obtained by iMAR reconstruction of the polychromatic data without the need to implement VME at high-energy levels."|||iMAR-VME 190 keV and iMAR-VME 150 keV created the least amount of high-density artifacts (all P < 0.001), whereas iMAR-Polychromatic was the most effective method to mitigate low-density streaks (P < 0.001).

In total hip and knee arthroplasty, irrigation and debridement (I&D) and polyethylene exchange with component retention has been studied extensively. However, there is minimal literature evaluating this treatment method for PJI in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate both the clinical and patient-reported outcomes and survivorship of TAA acute hematogenous PJIs treated with I&D and polyethylene exchange.
A single-center, retrospective chart review of prospectively collected data in patients with TAA PJI who subsequently underwent I&D and polyethylene exchange with retention of metal components was conducted. The primary outcome was failure rate of I&D and polyethylene exchange, where failure was defined as subsequent removal of all components and 2-stage revision or arthrodesis. Patient-reported outcomes collected before primary arthroplasty, after primary arthroplasty, and after polyethylene exchange were also analyzed.
We identified 14 patients with acute hematogenous PJI who underwent I&D and polyethylene exchange with retention of metal components. The mean time from primary TAA to symptoms was 43 months (range 1-147 months). The average time from onset of symptoms to I&D and polyethylene exchange was 11.4 ± 5.6 days. The mean follow-up after this surgery was 2.8 ± 1.5 years. The long-term failure rate was 54%. The most common bacteria isolated in patients who failed was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The most common bacteria isolated in patients who retained their implants was methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Visual analog scale (VAS), Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), Short Form-36 (SF-36), and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scale showed significant improvement when compared to preoperative scores in patients who retained their implants both after primary and after I&D and polyethylene exchange.
I&D and polyethylene exchange with retention of metal components has a long-term survivorship comparable to those reported in the total knee and total hip arthroplasty literature. Patient-reported outcomes after I&D and polyethylene exchange were comparable to those collected after primary arthroplasty in those patients who ultimately retained their implants. Two variables in this cohort that were associated with I&D and polyethylene exchange failure include time the patient was symptomatic prior to I&D as well as organism isolated on culture. With a failure rate of 54%, the authors recommend thorough evaluation on a case-by-case basis prior to indicating a patient for single-stage I&D with polyethylene exchange.

American volume|"Linking clinical registries to administrative claims data enables researchers to capitalize on the specific strengths of each data source with respect to the depth, breadth, and completeness of information. The objectives of this study were to link a health-system-based orthopaedic surgery registry to U.S. Medicare claims data without the use of unique identifiers and to assess the representativeness of the linked records.
The registry included clinical data for patients ≥65 years of age who underwent elective, inpatient total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) in a single health system during the period of 2007 through 2012. Registry participants were identified within the Medicare data by linking registry procedures to TAA procedures within the claims data using a combination of procedure date, patient date of birth, and patient sex. We assessed the representativeness of the linked records by comparing them to both unlinked registry records and unlinked Medicare records for TAA procedures. Additionally, we described the availability of postsurgical data for linked records.
Of 360 TAA registry participants ≥65 years of age, 280 (77.8%) were matched to a Medicare record; 250 (89.3%) of those 280 participants were matched on the basis of a linking rule that required an exact match for procedure date, date of birth, and sex. The 280 linked records comprised 5.5% of all Medicare TAA procedures among beneficiaries ≥65 years of age enrolled in the fee-for-service Medicare program (n = 5,070). Compared with linked records, unlinked records were more likely to be for patients 65 to 69 years old, but the 2 groups were similar in terms of sex, body mass index, and availability of clinical measurements. Of the linked records, 214 (76.4%) had ≥3 years of postoperative follow-up claims data.

The first 67 consecutive patients who underwent primary total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) with the Infinity system at 2 North American sites between August 2013 and May 2015 were reviewed in a prospective, observational study. Demographic, radiographic, and functional outcome data were collected preoperatively, at 6 to 12 months postoperatively, and annually thereafter.
The overall implant survival rate was 97% (65 of 67 implants) at a mean follow-up of 35.4 months (27 to 47 months). Two cases underwent talar component revision for aseptic loosening. Six of the 67 cases (9%) required a nonrevision reoperation. Mean Foot Function Index and Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale scores at latest follow-up improved from preoperative by 21.6 ( P < .0001) and 34.0 ( P < .0001), respectively. No radiographic loosening of any talar or tibial components was identified in the 65 nonrevised cases.
Early clinical and radiographic outcomes with the Infinity TAA are promising and compare favorably to those reported for both fixed- and mobile-bearing third-generation TAA designs, even when used in cases with deformity and increased case complexity.

This was a multisite prospective cohort study to compare ankle arthroplasty to ankle arthrodesis in the treatment of ESAA among 6 participating sites. We compared the risk and impact of nonankle AEs and ankle-specific AEs versus no AEs controlling for potential confounding factors, including operative procedure using multinomial logistic regression. We estimated differences in postoperative functional outcomes by AE occurrence using linear mixed effects regression. Among 517 patients who had surgery for ankle arthritis and completed the full baseline assessment, follow-up scores were available in 494 (95%) patients.
There were a total of 628 reported AEs (477 in the arthroplasty group and 151 in the arthrodesis group). These occurred in 261 (63%) arthroplasty patients and 67 (65%) arthrodesis patients. There were 50 (8%) ankle-specific AEs. The risk of an ankle-specific AE was slightly higher in the arthrodesis group versus the arthroplasty group, odds ratio (OR) 1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI, 0.85, 3.98). The OR for the risk of non-ankle-specific AE versus no AE was 0.96, 95% CI (0.57, 1.61) for those receiving arthrodesis compared to arthroplasty. Compared to patients with no AEs, those experiencing ankle-specific AEs had significantly less improvement in Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Sports and activities of daily living (ADL) subscores and worst pain outcomes; however, both groups improved significantly in all measures except mental health.
Ankle-specific AEs were infrequent and only weakly associated with operative procedure. Although patients improved in all functional outcomes except mental health, regardless of AE occurrence, ankle-specific AEs negatively impacted patient improvement compared to those with no AEs or a nonankle AE. The logistical effort and cost of tracking nonankle AEs does not seem to be justified.

American volume|"Preoperative ankle coronal malalignment has been considered as a risk factor for poor outcomes and failure after total ankle arthroplasty. The present study evaluated whether intermediate to long-term outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty in ankles with preoperative varus and valgus malalignment (5° to 20°) are comparable with those with neutral alignment (<5°).
We enrolled 144 consecutive ankles that underwent primary total ankle arthroplasty (140 patients) using a mobile-bearing HINTEGRA prosthesis with a minimum follow-up of 4 years; the mean overall follow-up duration was 89 months (51 to 145 months). We divided all patients into 3 groups according to the preoperative coronal plane tibiotalar angle: the varus group (59 ankles, 5° to 20° of varus), the valgus group (34 ankles, 5° to 20° of valgus), and the neutral group (51 ankles, <5°). Patients in each group showed similar characteristics in mean age, sex, body mass index, and follow-up period.
The mean Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale pain and disability score, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score, Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary score, visual analog scale pain score, and ankle range of motion did not differ meaningfully among the 3 groups at the final follow-up. The final tibiotalar angle showed that the degree of coronal alignment of the varus group was significantly less corrected compared with the neutral group (p = 0.010). The varus group had significantly more concomitant procedures (42 procedures [71.2%]) compared with the neutral group (p = 0.003). The prevalence of major complications did not differ among the 3 groups (p = 0.124). The overall probability of implant survivorship was 91.1% (97.7% in the varus group, 81.1% in the valgus group, and 90.9% in the neutral group) at a mean follow-up of 7.3 years.
In the intermediate to long-term follow-up, mobile-bearing total ankle arthroplasty showed similarly good outcomes in patients with varus and valgus malalignment up to 20° compared with the neutral alignment group when neutrally aligned ankles were achieved postoperatively.

Chronic ankle instability (CAI) resulting from an ankle sprain might have severe long-lasting consequences on the ankle joint. Despite the fact that most patients will respond favourably to appropriate conservative treatment, around 20% will develop symptomatic CAI with sense of giving away and recurrent sprains leading to functional impairment. ""Classical"" surgical repair by Brostrom-like surgery in one of its many modifications has achieved good results over the years. Recently, major advances in surgical techniques have enabled arthroscopic repair of ankle instability with favourable outcome while also enabling the treatment of other concomitant lesions: loose bodies, osteochondral defects (OCDs) or ankle impingement. Moreover, when the tissue remnant does not permit a repair technique, anatomic reconstruction by means of using a free graft has been developed. In many cases, OCDs occur as a consequence of CAI. However, traumatic and non-traumatic aetiologies have been described. There is no evidence favouring any surgical treatment over another concerning OCDs. Considering lower cost and limited aggression, microfracture is still the most frequent surgical approach. Herein, the authors describe their algorithm in the treatment of these conditions. Similarly, anterior or posterior impingement might be linked with CAI. These are clinical syndromes based on clinical diagnosis which are currently managed arthroscopically upon failure of conservative treatment."|||||10.1007/978-3-319-76735-2_4|2018-05-08|"[{'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Hélder', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""3B's Research Group\xa0- Biomaterials, Biodegradables and Biomimetics, University of Minho, Headquarters of the European Institute of Excellence on Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine,, Avepark, Parque de Ciência e Tecnologia, Zona Industrial da Gandra, Barco, Guimarães, Portugal. helderduartepereira@gmail.com.\nICVS/3B's\xa0- PT Government Associated Laboratory, Braga/Guimarães, Portugal. helderduartepereira@gmail.com.\nOrthopedic Department of Póvoa de Varzim\xa0- Vila do Conde Hospital Centre, Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal. helderduartepereira@gmail.com.\nRipoll y De Prado Sports Clinic: Murcia-Madrid FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence, Murcia/Madrid, Spain. helderduartepereira@gmail.com.\nInternational Centre of Sports Traumatology of the Ave, Taipas, Portugal. helderduartepereira@gmail.com.""}, {'lastname': 'Vuurberg', 'firstname': 'Gwendolyn', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam Movement Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nAcademic Center for Evidence Based Sports Medicine, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nAmsterdam Collaboration for Health and Safety in Sports, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Spennacchio', 'firstname': 'Pietro', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Clinique du Sport, Centre Hospitalier Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.'}, {'lastname': 'Batista', 'firstname': 'Jorge', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Department Club Atletico Boca Juniores and CAJB\xa0- Centro Artroscopico, Jorge batista SA, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Hooghe"", 'firstname': 'Pieter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Aspire Zone, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Hunt', 'firstname': 'Kenneth', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Dijk', 'firstname': 'Niek', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Ripoll y De Prado Sports Clinic: Murcia-Madrid FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence, Murcia/Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam Movement Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nAcademic Center for Evidence Based Sports Medicine, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nAmsterdam Collaboration for Health and Safety in Sports, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}]"

Recent studies proposed an original saddle-shaped, skewed, truncated cone with laterally oriented apex, as tibiotalar contact surfaces for ankle prosthesis. The goal of this study was to compare in vitro this novel design with traditional cylindrical or medially centered conic geometries in terms of their ability to replicate the natural ankle joint mechanics. Ten lower limb cadaver specimens underwent a validated process of custom design for the replacement of the natural ankle joint. The process included medical imaging, 3D modeling and printing of implantable sets of artificial articular surfaces based on these three geometries. Kinematics and flexibility of the overall ankle complex, along with the separate ankle and subtalar joints, were measured under cyclic loading. In the neutral and in maximum plantarflexion positions, the range of motion under torques in the three anatomical planes of the three custom artificial surfaces was not significantly different from that of the natural surfaces. In maximum dorsiflexion the difference was significant for all three artificial surfaces at the ankle complex, and only for the cylindrical and medially centered conic geometries at the tibiotalar joint. Natural joint flexibility was restored by the artificial surfaces nearly in all positions. The present study provides experimental support for designing articular surfaces matching the specific morphology of the ankle to be replace, and lays the foundations of the overall process for designing and manufacturing patient-specific total ankle replacements.||||Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a formal cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic tree to explore the healthcare costs and health outcomes associated with a scenario of no prophylaxis and a scenario of routine LMWH prophylaxis for 4 weeks. The 2 scenarios were compared for 5 procedures: (1) Achilles tendon repair (ATR), (2) total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), (3) hallux valgus surgery (HVS), (4) hindfoot arthrodesis (HA), and (5) ankle fracture surgery (AFS). The outcomes assessed included short- and long-term costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY gained. The costs were evaluated from the healthcare system perspective and are expressed in U.S. dollars at a 2015 price base. In the short term, routine prophylaxis was always associated with greater costs compared with no prophylaxis. For ATR, TAA, HA, and AFS, prophylaxis was associated with slightly better health outcomes; however, the gain in QALYs was minimal compared with the cost of prophylaxis (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well above $50,000/QALY threshold). For HVS, prophylaxis was associated with both worse health outcomes and greater costs. In the long term, routine prophylaxis was always associated with worse health outcomes and either cost more (HA, AFS, HVS) or saved very little (ATR, TAA). We concluded that policies encouraging the routine use of LMWH after foot/ankle surgery are unlikely to be cost-effective.

Although numerous studies have associated blood transfusion with complications following hip and knee arthroplasty, its effects following TAA are largely unknown. This study uses data from a large, nationally representative database to estimate the association between blood transfusion and inpatient complications and hospital costs following TAA.
Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2004 to 2014, 25 412 patients who underwent TAA were identified, with 286 (1.1%) receiving a blood transfusion. Univariate analysis assessed patient and hospital factors associated with blood transfusion following TAA.
Patients requiring blood transfusion were more likely to be female, African American, Medicare recipients, and treated in nonteaching hospitals. Average length of stay for patients following transfusion was 3.0 days longer, while average inpatient cost was increased by approximately 50%. Patients who received blood transfusion were significantly more likely to suffer from congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, hypothyroidism, coagulation disorder, or anemia. Acute renal failure was significantly more common among patients receiving blood transfusion ( P < .001).
Blood transfusions following TAA are infrequent and are associated with multiple medical comorbidities, increased complications, longer hospital stays, and increased overall cost.

A total of 23 TAAs, in 22 patients, were revised for aseptic loosening and balloon osteolysis to a hindfoot fusion by a single surgeon (NH) between January 2012 and August 2014. The procedure was carried out without bone graft using the Phoenix, Biomet Hindfoot Arthrodesis Nail. Preoperative investigations included full blood count, CRP and ESR, and radiological investigations including plain radiographs and CT scans. Postoperative plain radiographs were assessed for fusion. When there was any doubt, CT scans were performed.
The mean follow-up was 13.9 months (4.3 to 37.2). Union occurred at the tibiotalar joint in 22 ankles (95.6%) with one partial union. Union occurred at the subtalar joint in 20 ankles (87%) of cases with two nonunions. The nail broke in one patient with a subtalar nonunion and revision was undertaken.

This study aimed to assess the early complications, reoperations, and radiographic and clinical outcomes of the Infinity TAA. To date, clinical results of this novel implant have not been published.
A retrospective analysis of 64 consecutive ankles that underwent a primary Infinity TAA from July 2014 to April 2016 was performed. Patients had an average follow-up of 24.5 (range, 18-39) months. Medical records were reviewed to determine the incidence of complications, reoperations, and revisions. Radiographic outcomes included preoperative and postoperative tibiotalar alignment, tibial implant positioning, the presence of periprosthetic radiolucency and cysts, and evidence of subsidence or loosening. Additionally, patient-reported outcomes were analyzed with the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS).
Survivorship of the implant was 95.3%. Fourteen ankles (21.8%) presented a total of 17 complications. A total of 12 reoperations were necessary in 11 ankles (17.1%). Revision surgery was indicated for 3 ankles (4.7%) as a result of subsidence of the implant. Tibiotalar coronal deformity was significantly improved after surgery ( P < .0001) and maintained during latest follow-up ( P = .81). Periprosthetic radiolucent lines were observed around the tibial component in 20 ankles (31%) and around the talar component in 2 ankles (3.1%). A tibial cyst was observed in 1 ankle (1.5%). Outcome scores were significantly improved for all FAOS components analyzed ( P < .0001), from 39.0 to 83.3 for pain, from 34.0 to 65.2 for symptoms, from 52.3 to 87.5 for activities of daily living, and from 15.7 to 64.2 for quality of life.
Most complications observed in the study were minor and successfully treated with a single reoperation procedure or nonoperatively. Failures and radiographic abnormalities were most commonly related to the tibial implant. Further studies with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate the survivorship of the tibial implant in the long term.

The aim is to investigate revision rates and the underlying reasons, as well as treatment outcome and quality of life after TAA in post-traumatic cases with sufficient follow-up.
In 2008-2013, 74 patients with post-traumatic arthrosis were treated using TAA with a Tornier Salto prosthesis, and 60 (35 males and 25 females; mean age 56) were followed-up (mean: 59 months; range 24-91 months).
The revision rate after TAA was 42% (n = 25), and it was 8% after 12 months and 18% after 24 months. Twenty percent of the patients had significant symptomatic periprosthetic bone cysts, 5% had impingement, 3% had soft tissue infections, and, in 14%, revision was caused by other factors. The most commonly performed procedures were cyst debridement and autologous spongy bone grafting (20%). Fifteen percent (n = 9) of the prosthetics were explanted or switched to a tibiotalar arthrodesis (TTA). The mean AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) score was 55.15 (range 12-100) and the mean FAO (Foot and Ankle Outcome) score was 49.6 (range 18-100).

American volume|"In the last 2 decades, total ankle replacement has gained greater acceptance as a treatment option in patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. However, there is a lack of literature on total ankle replacement using a lateral transfibular approach. Therefore, we sought to report early clinical and radiographic results for a patient cohort treated with total ankle replacement using a lateral transfibular approach, performed by a single surgeon.
From October 2012 to December 2014, 55 primary total ankle arthroplasties using the Zimmer Trabecular Metal Total Ankle implant were performed in 54 patients (29 male and 25 female; mean age, 67.0 years). Clinical assessment, including pain evaluation and measurement of ankle range of motion, was conducted preoperatively and at the latest follow-up. Weight-bearing radiographs were used to determine angular alignment of the tibial and talar components and to analyze the bone-implant interface. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, revision surgeries, and survivorship were evaluated.
Implant survival was 93% at 24 months of follow-up. There were 3 revisions of a tibial component due to aseptic loosening. In 10 of the 55 cases, a secondary procedure was performed during follow-up. The mean follow-up duration was 26.6 ± 4.2 months. No delayed union or nonunion was observed for fibular healing. The average visual analog scale (VAS) pain score decreased significantly, from 7.9 ± 1.3 to 0.8 ± 1.2. The average total range of motion increased significantly, from 22.9° ± 12.7° to 40.2° ± 11.8°.
Early results of total ankle replacement using the Zimmer trabecular metal implant and the lateral transfibular approach demonstrated improved patient-reported outcomes and increased ankle motion at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. In the 55 consecutive cases, the fibular osteotomy required for access to the ankle healed without complications. Painful early loosening due to lack of osseous ingrowth required revision in 3 of 55 cases.

Ankle arthrodesis is a common surgical option, especially for younger and highly active patients; however, ankle arthroplasty has become increasingly popular as advancements in implant design improve device longevity. The longitudinal differences in biomechanical outcomes between these surgical treatments remain indistinct, likely due to the challenges associated with objective study of a heterogeneous population.
Patients scheduled for arthroplasty (n = 27) and arthrodesis (n = 20) were recruited to participate in this three-year prospective study. Postoperative functional outcomes were compared at distinct annual time increments using measures of gait analysis, average daily step count and survey score.
Both surgical groups presented reduced pain, improved survey scores, and increased walking speed at the first-year postoperative session, which were generally consistent across the three-year follow-up. Arthrodesis patients walked with decreased sagittal ankle RoM, increased sagittal hip RoM, increased step length, and increased transient force at heel strike, postoperatively. Arthroplasty patients increased ankle RoM and cadence, with no changes in hip RoM, step length or heel strike transient force.
Most postoperative changes were detected at the first-year follow-up session and maintained across the three-year time period. Despite generally favorable outcomes associated with both surgeries, several underlying postoperative biomechanical differences were detected, which may have long-term functional consequences. Furthermore, neither technique was able to completely restore gait biomechanics to the levels of the contralateral unaffected limb, leaving potential for the development of improved surgical and rehabilitative treatments."||||Published by Elsevier Ltd.|10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2018.02.018|2018-03-20|[{'lastname': 'Segal', 'firstname': 'Ava D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'Center for Limb Loss and MoBility, Rehabilitation Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cyr', 'firstname': 'Krista M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Center for Limb Loss and MoBility, Rehabilitation Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Stender', 'firstname': 'Christina J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Center for Limb Loss and MoBility, Rehabilitation Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Whittaker', 'firstname': 'Eric C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': 'Center for Limb Loss and MoBility, Rehabilitation Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hahn', 'firstname': 'Michael E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Center for Limb Loss and MoBility, Rehabilitation Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Seattle, WA, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Orendurff', 'firstname': 'Michael S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Center for Limb Loss and MoBility, Rehabilitation Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ledoux', 'firstname': 'William R', 'initials': 'WR', 'affiliation': 'Center for Limb Loss and MoBility, Rehabilitation Research and Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Seattle, WA, USA; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; Department of Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.

Once these patients become unable to perform their job duties, they leave the workforce and require financial aid from government agencies, which represents a considerable economic burden. Regardless of whether arthrodesis or arthroplasty is performed, we hypothesized that patients younger than 55 years at the time of surgery should be able to return to work within 2 years and require less social assistance.
Patients from 2002 to 2014 included in the nationwide prospective Ankle Reconstruction Database treated for end-stage ankle arthritis with a total ankle replacement or an ankle arthrodesis and younger than 55 years at the time of surgery were included. This study used a standard preoperative survey (AAOS, SF-36) along with the same survey filled by patients in intervals up to 2 years postoperatively. Their employment status was determined at each time point. Participation in third-party wage assistance programs was recorded. This cohort had 194 patients with an average age of 47.0 ± 7.2 years and was balanced in terms of sex (104 female) and side (94 left).

Limited and conflicting data are available regarding the change in sagittal foot and ankle range of motion after revision total ankle replacement surgery. We sought to determine whether revision total ankle replacements would reduce compensatory midfoot range of motion. In determining this, a novel radiographic measurement system with stable osseous landmarks is used. A retrospective medical record review of patients who had undergone revision total ankle replacement from January 2009 to June 2016 was performed. Thirty-three patients (33 ankles) underwent revision total ankle replacement surgery and met the inclusion criteria with a mean follow-up period of 28.39 ± 14.68 (range 2 to 59) months. Investigation of preoperative and postoperative weightbearing lateral radiographic images was performed to determine the global foot and ankle, isolated ankle, and isolated midfoot sagittal ranges of motion. Statistical analysis revealed a significant increase in ankle range of motion (p = .046) and a significant decrease in midfoot range of motion (p < .001) from preoperatively to postoperatively. The change in global foot and ankle range of motion was not significant (p = .53).

Up to now, little attention has focused on the contact between the bones and the talar component. MATERIAL AND METHODS In order to address implant subsidence and medial tilt, one three-dimensional finite element model of contact between the bone and the talar components was built with the material properties of the cancellous bone interpolated from the experimental data, which represents variation of material properties through the cancellous bones. The finite element model was used to study the following: variation of the Young's modulus of the bones, stiffness of the talar component, loading direction, and loading magnitude with the implant subsidence. RESULTS The computational results reveal that a variety of Young's modulus of the cancellous bones causes the medial tilting of the talar component and that big plastic strains are associated with tilting. The implant subsidence increases from 0.169 mm to 0.269 mm when the loading changes from 272 kg to 408 kg. However, to the contrary, the implant subsidence decreases from 0.2676 mm to 0.1783 mm when Young's modulus of the bones increases 50%. However, the implant subsidence shows little change with a different Young's modulus of the talar component from 88 GPa to 132 GPa. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that a variety of different Young's modulus of the cancellous bones cause the medial tilting of the talar component. To solve subsidence and tilting, both the contact area and the variation of material properties should be taken into account.|||||10.12659/msm.906151|2018-02-24|[{'lastname': 'Cui', 'firstname': 'Yunwei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Orthopedic Research Institution of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Biomechanics of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China (mainland).'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Pan', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Orthopedic Research Institution of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Biomechanics of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China (mainland).'}, {'lastname': 'Wei', 'firstname': 'Ning', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Orthopedic Research Institution of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Biomechanics of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China (mainland).'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Xiaodong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Orthopedic Research Institution of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Biomechanics of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China (mainland).'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Wenli', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Orthopedic Research Institution of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Biomechanics of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China (mainland).'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Orthopedic Research Institution of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Biomechanics of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China (mainland).'}]

The traditional surgical approach for TAR is the anterior approach. Recently, the lateral transfibular approach to the ankle has gained popularity since a new TAR implant was designed to be performed via this approach that results in an ideal visualization of the center of rotation of the ankle and curved resections that allow for sparing bone cuts. The aim of the present paper is to present our preoperative, operative, and postoperative protocols for the treatment of the osteoarthritis of the ankle with TAR via lateral approach. We present our preoperative clinical and radiographic protocol. In addition, we describe our surgical technique with some technical tips. Finally, we report our follow-up schedule that includes the collection of clinical, functional, and radiographic data. The results of this procedure are encouraging: TAR through a lateral transfibular approach provides reliable pain relief and improvements in functional outcomes in patients with ankle osteoarthritis.|||||10.3791/56396|2018-02-15|"[{'lastname': 'Usuelli', 'firstname': 'Federico G', 'initials': 'FG', 'affiliation': 'Galeazzi Orthopedic Institute for Research and Care; fusuelli@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Ambrosi"", 'firstname': 'Riccardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Galeazzi Orthopedic Institute for Research and Care; Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche per la Salute, Università degli Studi di Milano.'}, {'lastname': 'Manzi', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Galeazzi Orthopedic Institute for Research and Care.'}, {'lastname': 'Maccario', 'firstname': 'Camilla', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Galeazzi Orthopedic Institute for Research and Care; Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche per la Salute, Università degli Studi di Milano.'}, {'lastname': 'Indino', 'firstname': 'Cristian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Galeazzi Orthopedic Institute for Research and Care.'}]"

Tibiotalar fusion and total ankle replacement are treatment options for managing ankle arthritis. Few studies have examined short term readmission rates of these two procedures. The objective of this study was compare all-cause 30-day readmission rates between patients undergoing tibiotalar fusion vs. total ankle replacement.
This study queried the Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) from 2013-2014 and used international classification of disease, 9th revision (ICD-9) procedure codes to identify all patients who underwent a tibiotalar fusion or a total ankle replacement. Comorbidities, insurance status, hospital characteristics, and readmission rates were statistically compared between the two cohorts. Risk factors were then identified for 30-day readmission.
A total of 5660 patients were analyzed with 2667 in the tibiotalar fusion cohort and 2993 in the total ankle replacement cohort. Univariate analysis revealed that the readmission rate after tibiotalar fusion (4.4%) was statistically greater than after total ankle replacement (1.4%). Multivariable regression analysis indicated that deficiency anemia (OR 2.18), coagulopathy (OR 3.51), renal failure (OR 2.83), other insurance relative to private (OR 3.40), and tibiotalar fusion (OR 2.51) were all statistically significant independent risk factors for having a readmission within 30-days.

Reconstruction and fusion of the ankle is often the first choice for revision procedures due to the large bone defects, which are typically filled with autograft and/or allograft. Filling the defect with a trabecular metal tantalum implant is a potential alternative given the biomechanical properties of this component.
Using tantalum as a spacer provides primary stability and contributes to fusion of the ankle joint after removal of failed TAR implants.
Eleven patients underwent arthrodesis an average of 6.9 years after TAR. The mean height of the bone defect was 32mm. It was filled with a specially designed quadrangular implant (Trabecular Metal™, Zimmer/Biomet) combined with an iliac crest graft. Ten patients underwent tibio-talo-calcaneal (TTC) arthrodesis fixed with an angled retrograde nail and one patient underwent talocrural arthrodesis fixed with two plates (anterolateral and anteromedial). The clinical, functional (AOFAS and SF36 scores) and radiological (plain X-rays and CT scan) outcomes were determined.
At a mean follow-up of 19.3 months, the mean total AOFAS score was 56 (21-78) and the mean SF36 score was 60.5 (19-84). One patient was lost to follow-up and four patients still had pain. The tantalum implant was integrated in six patients. Five patients achieved fusion of the subtalar joint and 8 achieved fusion of the talocrural joint. Three patients required surgical revision.
Our hypothesis was not confirmed. The clinical outcomes after more than 1 year of follow-up are disappointing, as was the large number of nonunion cases and the lack of tantalum integration. These technical failures can be explained by insufficient construct stability and/or insufficient implant porosity.

Currently in its fourth generation, the Scandanavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) is the only 3-piece mobile bearing ankle prosthesis available in the United States. Our current study reports implant survivorship at 15 years and patient outcomes for a subset of these survivors available for study.
Eighty-four TAAs were performed between 1998 and 2000. Metal component survivorship at 15 years was calculated with a Kaplan-Meier curve. Twenty-four (29%) of 84 patients were available for participation with a minimum 15-year follow-up. Any radiographic changes were documented. All additional procedures and complications were recorded. Clinical findings, self-reported performance and pain evaluations, and AOFAS ankle/hindfoot scores were noted.
Metal implant survival was 73% at 15 years.

This study reports the functional, radiological outcomes and satisfaction rates in our Asian population.
Patients who underwent primary total ankle arthroplasty from 2007 to 2013 were recruited. Outcomes evaluated were the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Score (AHS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the Short Form 36 (SF-36)questionnaire. Outcome scores were collected prospectively up to 2 years. Patient satisfaction was evaluated on a 6-point scale based on North American Spine Society Low Back Pain Instrument and classified as satisfied or unsatisfied.
Forty-one patients underwent primary total ankle arthroplasty. All patients experienced improvements in AHS, VAS, and Mental Component Summary score of the SF-36 at both 6-month and 2-year postoperative interval. The mean AHS score improved from 35 ± 19 points preoperatively to 64 ± 24 at 6 months (P<.001) and 72 ± 26 at 24 months (P <.001). VAS scores improved from 7 ± 2 preoperatively to 3 ± 3 (P < .001) at 6 and 24 months. The Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36 has an established minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 5. The mean improvement in PCS in our cohort met this MCID for the PCS; 63% and 71% of patients were satisfied with the procedure at 6 months and 2 years postoperatively, respectively.

359|29316589|A Comparison of Relative Value Units in Primary versus Revision Total Ankle Arthroplasty.|[]|Surgical technology international|"To determine the effort required to provide a service, the United States Medicare uses Relative Value Units (RVUs). Consequently, higher RVUs are assigned to the procedures or services that require more effort, which ultimately means the physician will be properly compensated for the additional effort required. In total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), revision cases usually are more technically challenging and require more effort than primary TAA. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the: 1) RVUs; 2) length-of-surgery; 3) RVU per unit of time between primary and revision total ankle arthroplasty; and 4) the individualized idealized surgeon annual cost difference analysis.
We utilized the American College of Surgeons, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2008 to 2015 to identify patients who underwent either a primary Current Procedural Terminology [CPT]: 27702) or revision (CPT: 27703) TAA. There were a total of 653 patients, 586 of which underwent a primary, and 67 who underwent a revision, TAA. The mean RVUs, length of surgery (in minutes), and RVU per minute, were calculated. Dollar amount per minute, per case, per day, and per year, to find an individualized idealized surgeon annual cost difference, were also calculated. An analysis of variance was used to compare variables between primary and revision TAA. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
The mean RVU was significantly higher in revision versus primary TAA (16.93 vs. 14.41, p=0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the mean lengths of surgery between primary and revision TAA (160 vs. 157 minutes, p=0.613). Additionally, the mean RVU per minute was significantly higher in revision versus primary TAA (0.13 vs. 0.10, p=0.001).
Based on the results of this study, it appears that revision TAA cases are appropriately assigned a higher RVU per minute for performing them as they require more effort and are more challenging compared to the primary TAA. Furthermore, not only did the revision cases have lower mean lengths of surgery, but they also maintained a higher RVU per minute. Therefore, orthopaedists can use this information to further help them yield the best potential practice design."|Based on the results of this study, it appears that revision TAA cases are appropriately assigned a higher RVU per minute for performing them as they require more effort and are more challenging compared to the primary TAA.

Patients undergoing TAR at a single academic medical center between 2007 and 2013 were evaluated in this study. In addition to a minimum of 2-year follow-up, complete preoperative and postoperative outcome measures for the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI), Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) Bother and Function Indices, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were requisite for inclusion. Standardized weightbearing maximum dorsiflexion and plantarflexion sagittal radiographs were obtained and previously described ankle and foot measurements were performed to determine ankle ROM.
Eighty-eight patients met inclusion criteria (33 INBONE, 18 Salto-Talaris, 37 STAR). Mean time to final ROM radiographs was 43.8 months (range 24-89 months). All aforementioned PROMs improved between preoperative evaluation and most recent follow-up (  P < .01). Final ankle ROM was significantly correlated with postoperative FADI, SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS), SMFA Bother and Function Indices, and VAS. Additionally, dorsiflexion was positively associated with FADI, SF-36 MCS, and SMFA Function (  P < .05) but plantarflexion had no such influence on outcomes. No differences were identified with subset stratification by prosthesis type, fixed versus mobile-bearing design or etiology.
In this TAR cohort with prospectively collected outcomes data, radiographic sagittal plane ankle motion was positively correlated with multiple PROMs. Disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life PROMs demonstrated improvement postoperatively in all domains when evaluating final total range of motion. Patients who undergo TAR for end-stage osteoarthritis with improvement in ROM demonstrate a direct correlation with improved patient-centric metrics and outcome scores.

In the presence of advanced articular deterioration, therapeutic options are confined to either arthroplasty or arthrodesis, the latter still being referred to as the procedure of choice. However, total ankle replacement (TAR) has recently gained acceptance as an alternative.
To investigate the mid- to long-term results of TAR in haemophilic ankle arthropathy.
Seventeen TARs in 14 male patients (mean age: 43 years [range, 27.4-57.6]), implanted between 1998 and 2012, were retrospectively analysed. Implant survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Haemophilic/viral status, complications and revision surgeries were recorded. Follow-up assessment of 12 TARs was performed 9.6 years (range, 3.3-17.8) postoperatively, including clinical examination, pain and satisfaction scales, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score, and the SF-36. Radiographic evaluation of pre- and follow-up radiographs was conducted.
Estimated implant survival was 94% at 5, 85% at 10 and 70% at 15 years, respectively. Three cases required revision surgery. At follow-up, 9.6 years (range, 3.3-17.8) postoperatively, the level of satisfaction was 76% (range, 50-100) and of pain 2/10 (range, 0-6) on the VAS. Range of motion had increased significantly (P = .037). The SF-36 summary scores were comparable to those of a matched standard population. The AOFAS hindfoot score averaged 81 points (range, 73-90).

This includes total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), which is performed far less frequently than total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty. We used the SPARCS database to identify 537 TAA and 239,053 elective primary THA or TKA procedures from 2009 to 2014, excluding hip fractures. Compared with THA and TKA, TAA had a shorter mean length of stay (2.2 versus 3.2 days), greater mean cost ($20,817 versus $17,613), lower rate of disposition to nursing and rehabilitation facilities (17% versus 52%), and lower rate of 90-day readmission (4.9% versus 5.8%). In multivariable-adjusted regression models of TAA versus THA and TKA, length of stay was 30% shorter (p < .001), costs were 14% greater (p < .001), and risk of disposition to nursing and rehabilitation facilities was 86% lower (p < .001), with no significant difference in 90-day readmission (p = .957). Patients undergoing TAA had different patterns of short-term resource usage compared with patients undergoing THA and TKA, most notably higher short-term costs. The economic viability of TAA is threatened by alternative payment models that reimburse hospitals for TAA at the same rate as THA and TKA.||||Copyright © 2017 The American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Treatment characteristics and outcome parameters (overall postoperative outcome and complication rate) were reviewed.
When counseling patients who are considering their options with regard to ankle arthritis treatment, surgeons should determine on an individual basis which procedure is more suitable.
TAR has become an accepted treatment for end-stage OA, but revision rates for TAR are significant higher than for AA (odds ratio 2.28 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-3.19; P < 0.0001).
The results of TAA are gradually improving, but the procedure cannot yet be recommended for the routine management of ankle OA.
Although there is some evidence to support TAR to conserve ankle motion and offer improved function and decreased pain with high satisfaction rates, revision rates for TAR are significantly higher than revision rates for AA. Proper patient selection should be better addressed in future studies for successful treatment of end-stage ankle OA.

367|29178861|Contact stresses, pressure and area in a fixed-bearing total ankle replacement: a finite element analysis.|['Ankle arthroplasty ankle osteoarthritis', 'Contact stress']|BMC musculoskeletal disorders|"Mobile-bearing ankle implants with good clinical results continued to increase the popularity of total ankle arthroplasty to address endstage ankle osteoarthritis preserving joint movement. Alternative solutions used fixed-bearing designs, which increase stability and reduce the risk of bearing dislocation, but with a theoretical increase of contact stresses leading to a higher polyethylene wear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contact stresses, pressure and area in the polyethylene component of a new total ankle replacement with a fixed-bearing design, using 3D finite element analysis.
A three-dimensional finite element model of the Zimmer Trabecular Metal Total Ankle was developed and assembled based on computed tomography images. Three different sizes of the polyethylene insert were modeled, and a finite element analysis was conducted to investigate the contact pressure, the von Mises stresses and the contact area of the polyethylene component during the stance phase of the gait cycle.
The peak value of pressure was found in the anterior region of the articulating surface, where it reached 19.8 MPa at 40% of the gait cycle. The average contact pressure during the stance phase was 6.9 MPa. The maximum von Mises stress of 14.1 MPa was reached at 40% of the gait cycle in the anterior section. In the central section, the maximum von Mises stress of 10.8 MPa was reached at 37% of the gait cycle, whereas in the posterior section the maximum stress of 5.4 MPa was reached at the end of the stance phase.
The new fixed-bearing total ankle replacement showed a safe mechanical behavior and many clinical advantages. However, advanced models to quantitatively estimate the wear are need.
To the light of the clinical advantages, we conclude that the presented prosthesis is a good alternative to the other products present in the market."|To the light of the clinical advantages, we conclude that the presented prosthesis is a good alternative to the other products present in the market.||The peak value of pressure was found in the anterior region of the articulating surface, where it reached 19.8 MPa at 40% of the gait cycle.

Outpatient TAA are increasingly common and have been shown to decrease costs compared to inpatient surgery. However, there are very few studies examining the safety of outpatient TAA. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 65 consecutive patients who received outpatient TAA to identify complication rates.
The medical records of 65 consecutive outpatient TAA from October 2012 to May 2016 with a minimum 6-month follow-up were reviewed. All patients received popliteal and saphenous blocks prior to surgery and were managed with oral pain medication postoperatively. All received a STAR total ankle. Demographics, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, and perioperative complications including wound breakdown, infection, revision, and nonrevision surgeries were observed. Mean follow-up was 16.6 ± 9.1 months (range, 6-42 months).
There were no readmissions for pain control and 1 patient had a wound infection. The overall complication rate was 15.4%. One ankle (1.5%) had a wound breakdown requiring debridement and flap coverage. This patient thrombosed a popliteal artery stent 1 month postop. The 1 ankle (1.5%) with a wound infection occurred in a patient with diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis.
This study demonstrates the safety of outpatient TAA. The combination of regional anesthesia and oral narcotics provided a satisfactory experience with no readmissions for pain control and 1 wound infection. The 1 wound breakdown complication (1.5%) was attributed to arterial occlusion and not outpatient management.

However, technical challenges are present when treating patients without a sufficient fibular buttress. We describe a technique for restoration of an adequate fibular buttress using an iliac crest bone graft or malleolar relocation. The results of 10 patients with an average follow-up period of 56 (range 24 to 123) months are presented. Of the 10 patients, 3 underwent tricortical iliac bone augmentation of the fibula, 4 underwent repositioning of the remnant fibula, and in 3, the in situ fibula was used. The average interval from fusion to takedown was 15.1 (range 5 to 35) years, and the average age at takedown was 52.8 (range 33 to 75) years. The average improvement in the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot scale and Buechel-Pappas scale scores was 35.8 (range 30 to 46) and 34 (range 25 to 42), respectively. Three patients underwent a total of 7 subsequent operations related to the ankle implant. Only 1 of the patients had any residual frontal plane deformity. None of the patients exhibited any component subsidence; however, 2 patients experienced asymptomatic lateral talar component overgrowth. The improvement in the clinical scores in this group of patients suggests that takedown of an ankle arthrodesis with an insufficient fibula is a viable option to improve function. Various techniques to restore the lateral buttress can be used even with complete absence of the distal fibula.||||Copyright © 2017 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The third generation implants show an overall 8-year survival rate up to 93%. The main reported reason for early failure of TAA is aseptic loosening, cyst formation is also frequently reported. The aim of the present study is to use the finite element (FE) method to analyze the adaptive bone remodeling processes, including cyst formation after TAA.
Bone characteristics applied to the model corresponded to information obtained from computed tomography. Finite element models for the tibia and the talus were developed and implant components were virtually implanted.
The calculated total bone loss is 2% in the tibia and 17% in the talus. Cysts and areas of increased bone density were detectable dependent on prosthesis design in the tibia and talus.
Our FE simulation provides a theoretical explanation for cyst formation and increasing bone density depending on implant design. However, cysts are not mono-causal, histo-chemical reactions should also be considered. Further clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the relevance of cyst formation and therapeutic strategies."|Our FE simulation provides a theoretical explanation for cyst formation and increasing bone density depending on implant design.

Autografts and allografts have been known to undergo late collapse, because these options are not specifically designed to withstand the high loads of the foot and ankle. The inability to achieve the correct shape for reconstruction further limits their application. Large osseous defects will result during salvage after failed Lapidus bunionectomy, explantation of failed total ankle replacements, and nonunion of Evans calcaneal osteotomy. Each of 3 patients received a 4WEB custom 3-dimensional (3D) titanium truss implant (Patient Specific Custom Implant; 4WEB Medical, Inc., Frisco, TX) for reconstruction. The mean follow-up period was 17.33 ± 3.51 months. Significant improvement was seen in pain, with a successful return to activities of daily living. The 12-month postoperative computed tomography findings demonstrated incorporation of the implant to the surrounding cortical and cancellous bone. No signs of delayed complications, such as stress shielding or implant failure, were found. This is the first case series to describe the use of a custom 3D-printed titanium truss implant to successfully contribute to reconstruction in the setting of failed elective foot and ankle surgery.

American volume|"We analyzed self-reported outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients treated with ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement (TAR) during a time of transition from older to newer-generation TAR implants.
We performed a prospective cohort study comparing outcomes in 273 consecutive patients treated for ankle arthritis with arthrodesis or TAR between 2005 and 2011. Adult patients with end-stage ankle arthritis who were able to walk and willing and able to respond to surveys were included in the study. Patients were excluded when they had another lower-limb problem that might affect walking. At baseline and at 6, 12, 24, and 36-month follow-up visits, participants completed a pain score, a Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (MFA), and a Short Form-36 (SF-36) survey.
There was significant mean improvement in most outcomes after surgery regardless of procedure. In general, the greatest improvement occurred during the first 6 months of follow-up. Linear mixed-effects regression adjusted for differences at baseline in age, body mass index (BMI), and surgery type showed that at 6 months the scores were improved by a mean (and standard error) of 12.6 ± 0.7 (33%) on the MFA, 22.0 ± 1.4 (56%) on the SF-36 Physical Functioning (PF) scale, 32.4 ± 1.6 (93%) on the SF-36 Bodily Pain (BP) scale, and 4.0 ± 0.2 (63%) on the pain rating scale. The mean improvements in the MFA and SF-36 PF scores over the 3-year follow-up period were significantly better after the TARs than after the arthrodeses, with differences between the 2 groups of 3.6 ± 1.6 (p = 0.023) and 7.5 ± 2.9 (p = 0.0098), respectively. The differences between the 2 groups were slightly greater when only the newer TAR devices were compared with the arthrodeses (MFA = 3.8 ± 1.8 [p = 0.031], SF-36 PF = 8.8 ± 3.3 [p = 0.0074], SF-36 BP = 7.3 ± 3.6 [p = 0.045], and pain score = 0.8 ± 0.4 [p = 0.038]).
Patients reported improved comfort and function after both surgical treatments. The average improvement in the MFA and SF-36 PF scores was better after TAR than after arthrodesis, particularly when the TAR had been done with later-generation implants. Younger patients had greater functional improvements than older patients.

In this study, a single-surgeon series of intra- and postoperative complications as well as resultant reoperations/revisions of the Tornier Salto Talaris, a fixed-bearing TAA prosthesis, were reviewed.
Medical records from index procedure to latest follow-up of primary TAA were reviewed. Complications were categorized according to the Glazebrook classification; additional complications were documented. Concurrent procedures were recorded, and radiographs were analyzed for alignment, subsidence, and cyst formation. Time to complication onset and learning curve analyses were performed. One hundred four Salto Talaris TAA prostheses (96 patients), with an average follow-up of 46 months, were included.
Thirty-five complications were identified in 32 ankles with a 34% complication rate, resulting in 11 reoperations (5 TAA revisions). Technical error (n = 12), wound healing (n = 9), and aseptic loosening (n = 4) were the most common complications, and there were no statistically significant differences in demographics or follow-up duration between cases with versus without complications. In both the cohorts with and without complications, there were moderate, negative correlations between radiographically observed keel osteopenia and lucency (ρ = -0.548, P = .00125, and ρ = -0.416, P = .000303, respectively); also, in the complication cohort, a weak, positive correlation between subsidence and lucency (ρ = 0.357, P = .0450) was found.

The intention of this study was to develop and culturally adapt a German version of the Self-reported Foot and Ankle Score (SEFAS) and to evaluate reliability, validity and responsiveness.
According to Cross Cultural Adaptation of Self-Reported Measure guidelines forward and backward translation has been performed. The German SEFAS was investigated in 177 consecutive patients. 177 Patients completed the German SEFAS, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), Short-Form 36 and numeric scales for pain and disability (NRS) before and 118 patients 6 months after foot or ankle surgery. Test-Retest reliability, internal consistency, floor and ceiling effects, construct validity and minimal important change were analyzed.
The German SEFAS demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability with ICC values of 0.97. Cronbach's alpha (α) value of 0.89 demonstrated strong internal consistency. No floor or ceiling effects were observed for the German version of the SEFAS. As hypothesized SEFAS correlated strongly with FAOS and SF-36 domains. It showed moderate (ES/SRM > 0.5) responsiveness between preoperative assessment and postoperative follow-up.
The German version of the SEFAS demonstrated good psychometric properties. It proofed to be a valid and reliable instrument for use in foot and ankle patients.

A consecutive series of 149 patients, from 2007 to 2011, at a single institution were enrolled. Pain and patient-reported function were assessed preoperatively and at yearly follow-ups. We analyzed the data for complications, reoperations, and failures (defined as undergoing revision for exchange or removal of one or both metallic components for any reason). Patients were also grouped according to coronal plane tibiotalar alignment; either ≥10 degrees or <10 degrees, and these outcomes were compared. Our follow-up ranged from 48 to 113 months (average 5.9 years).
There was significant improvement ( P < .05) in the visual analog scale for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot scale, Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment, and Short Form 36-Item Health Survey scores at most recent follow-up. There were 14 implant failures with overall survivorship of 90.6% (135/149). Reasons for failure included cysts/loosening (7), talar subsidence (4), fractured component (1), impingement pain (1), and infection (1). Seventy-two patients (48.3%) with preoperative coronal plane deformity of ≥10 degrees varus or valgus were compared to 78 patients (51.7%) with <10 degrees deformity. There was no difference in patient outcome scores or revision rates between these patient groups. There was a statistically significant difference ( P = .039) in reoperation rates among patients with ≥10 degrees deformity (22.2%) compared to those without such a deformity (37.7%) Conclusion: Patients who underwent INBONE I fixed-bearing total ankle arthroplasty demonstrated significant improvement in outcomes at a mean of 5.9 years. Catastrophic talar component collapse did occur (2.7% of cases), but relatively rarely. The patients with preoperative coronal plane tibiotalar deformity had similar pain relief, function, and need for revision of implant components.

383|28872529|In-Hospital Complications Following Ankle Arthrodesis Versus Ankle Arthroplasty: A Matched Cohort Study.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Ankle arthrodesis has been the traditional surgical treatment for end-stage hindfoot arthritis. However, utilization of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is increasing as surgical techniques and implants have substantially improved. The purpose of this study was to compare the U.S. national rates of perioperative (in-hospital) complications between a statistically matched cohort of patients who underwent either an ankle arthrodesis or a TAA.
Data from the 2002 to 2013 Nationwide Inpatient Sample releases were analyzed. The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes were used to identify 4,192 patients treated with TAA (ICD 81.56) and 16,278 treated with ankle arthrodesis (ICD 81.11). ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes were utilized to identify major and minor in-hospital complications, and mortality was determined using the Uniform Bill patient disposition. The arthrodesis and TAA groups were matched with regard to age, sex, race, surgery year, hospital type, comorbidities, adjunctive procedures, and surgical indication. Unadjusted and adjusted in-hospital complication risks were compared between groups using the Fisher exact test and multiple logistic regression analysis.
We were able to statistically match 1,574 patients who underwent a TAA (37.5%) with a patient who underwent arthrodesis. A major in-hospital complication occurred in 8.5% (134) of the 1,574 patients in the ankle arthrodesis group compared with 5.3% (84) of the 1,574 in the TAA group (p < 0.001) whereas a minor complication was found in 4.7% (74) in the ankle arthrodesis group compared with 5.9% (93) in the TAA group (p = 0.14). There were no deaths in either group. After adjusting for case mix, we found that ankle arthrodesis was 1.8 times more likely to be followed by a major complication (odds ratio [OR] = 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32 to 2.39) whereas the minor complication rate was 29% lower in that group (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.13).
In a matched cohort of 3,148 patients treated with either TAA or ankle arthrodesis, ankle arthrodesis was associated with a 1.8 times higher risk of a major complication but a 29% lower risk of a minor complication. Our findings are consistent with other studies that have shown TAA to be a safe procedure in the inpatient environment.

It was withdrawn in 2009, after identification of a higher than expected complication rate. The purpose of the current study was to analyse clinical outcomes, failures and survival of the initial series of 50 AES published in 2009.
In this single-centre continuous prospective study (2003-2006), 50 AES prostheses were included. Pre-operative osteoarthritis was mainly post-traumatic (50%) and secondary to instability (36%). All patients were assessed with clinical and radiographic follow-up at six months, one year, two years and every two to three years thereafter. A CT-scan was systematically performed before procedure, and at two years, five years and ten years. At last follow-up, all patients with TAR had a functional (SF 36, AOFAS) and clinical assessment. All complications or surgical events were analysed.
The mean follow-up was ten ± two years (range, 9-13). The mean AOFAS score was 75 points (range, 26-100). The mean SF 36 score was 69 points (range, 35-97). There was a significant deterioration in AOFAS score at five years and at last follow-up (p < 0.05). Fifteen TARs underwent reoperation for cyst curettage-graft because of development of periprosthetic lesions. Six of them ended up with prosthesis removal-arthrodesis. At the last follow-up, 14 TARs were removed for arthrodesis. Of the 30 prostheses seen at last follow-up, four are awaiting prosthesis removal-arthrodesis and one for cyst curettage-graft. The ten year survivorships free of any prosthesis removal or arthrodesis and free of any reoperation were 68% (95% CI, 55-85) and 57% (95% CI, 44-74), respectively.

391|28812410|Good outcome scores and high satisfaction rate after primary total ankle replacement.|[]|Acta orthopaedica|Background and purpose - Total ankle replacement (TAR) is gaining popularity for treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis. Large patient-centered outcome studies are, however, few. Here, we report data from the Swedish Ankle Registry. Patients and methods - We examined outcomes after primary TAR in patients from the Swedish Ankle Registry using PROMs (Patient Reported Outcome Measures; generic: EQ-5D and SF-36, region specific: SEFAS (Self-Reported Foot and Ankle Score), and a question on satisfaction). We included 241 patients registered with primary TAR between 2008 and 2016 and who completed PROMs preoperatively and postoperatively up to 24 months. We evaluated changes in PROMs following surgery and estimated effects of age, diagnosis, prosthetic design, and preoperative functional score on the outcomes. Results - All absolute scores improved from preoperative to 24 months after surgery (p ≤ 0.001). 71% of the patients were satisfied or very satisfied at the latest follow-up and 12% dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. Postoperative SEFAS correlated with age (r = 0.2, p = 0.01) and preoperative SEFAS (r = 0.3, p < 0.001), as did patient satisfaction (r = -0.2; p ≤ 0.03). Postoperative SEFAS and EQ-5D were similar between different diagnoses or prosthetic designs. Preoperative SF-36 was associated with diagnosis (p ≤ 0.03), postoperative SF-36 with age (r = 0.2, p = 0.01) and diagnosis (p < 0.03). Interpretation - We found statistically and clinically significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes following TAR surgery. The postoperative region-specific SEFAS was positively associated with older age. Prosthetic design seemed not to influence patient-reported outcome, whereas diagnosis partly did. Studies with longer follow-up are necessary to establish the long-term outcome of TAR and to elucidate whether short- and mid-term outcomes may predict implant failure.|||||10.1080/17453674.2017.1366405|2017-08-16|[{'lastname': 'Kamrad', 'firstname': 'Ilka', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'a Departments of Orthopedics and Clinical Sciences , Lund University and Skåne University Hospital , Malmö.'}, {'lastname': 'Carlsson', 'firstname': 'Åke', 'initials': 'Å', 'affiliation': 'a Departments of Orthopedics and Clinical Sciences , Lund University and Skåne University Hospital , Malmö.'}, {'lastname': 'Henricson', 'firstname': 'Anders', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'b Department of Orthopedics , Falu Central Hospital and Centre for Clinical Research Dalarna , Falun , Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Magnusson', 'firstname': 'Håkan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'a Departments of Orthopedics and Clinical Sciences , Lund University and Skåne University Hospital , Malmö.'}, {'lastname': 'Karlsson', 'firstname': 'Magnus K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'a Departments of Orthopedics and Clinical Sciences , Lund University and Skåne University Hospital , Malmö.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosengren', 'firstname': 'Björn E', 'initials': 'BE', 'affiliation': 'a Departments of Orthopedics and Clinical Sciences , Lund University and Skåne University Hospital , Malmö.'}]

TAA patient radiographs from a single institution were analyzed for peritalar arthritic changes by extrapolating the modified Kellgren Lawrence (KL) grades of the knee to the subtalar and talonavicular joints. Patients were included if they had a minimum of 5 years of follow-up. Patients who had undergone prior arthrodesis of the talonavicular or subtalar joints were excluded. A total of 140 patients with average follow-up of 6.5 years (range, 5.0-8.9 years) were included.
Overall, 27% of patients advanced 1 KL grade at the subtalar joint and 31% of patients increased 1 KL grade at the talonavicular joint. Furthermore, 60% and 66% of patients showed no progression in the subtalar and talonavicular joints, respectively. Two patients progressed greater than 2 KL subtalar arthritis grades and only 2 patients with talonavicular arthritis progressed to the same extent. Sixteen patients went on to require a subtalar arthrodesis compared to 2 requiring a talonavicular fusion ( P < .05).
This study suggests a moderate but nominal radiographic increase in adjacent subtalar and talonavicular arthritis over a minimum of 5 years after TAA. Future studies require a comparative control group of ankle fusion, but these data may suggest the motion preserved with an arthroplasty diminishes the stresses and compensatory motion incurred during tibiotalar arthrodesis.

The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative outcomes following TAA at an OSH when compared with a matching population of patients undergoing TAA at an academic teaching hospital (ATH).
We identified all TAA from January 2014 to December 2014 at the OSH and January 2010 to January 2016 at the ATH. Each OSH patient was manually matched with a corresponding ATH patient by clinical variables. Outcomes analyzed were length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmissions, mortality, reoperation, and inpatient rehabilitation utilization.
There were 40 TAA patients in each group. OSH and ATH patients were similar in age, body mass index, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, and gender. Average LOS for TAA at the OSH was 1.28 ± 0.51 compared with 2.03 ± 0.89 (P < .001) at the ATH. There were no OSH patients readmitted within 30 days, compared with 2 ATH patients readmitted (5.0%; P = .15). Two OSH patients (5.0%) and 2 ATH patients (5.0%; P = 1.00) required reoperation. There were no mortalities in either group. There were no OSH patients requiring transfer.

Continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block (CPSNB) is more commonly used for major foot and ankle reconstructions. The purpose of this study was to compare use of intraoperative LB injection to CPSNB as a regional anesthetic for total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), with attention to postoperative pain scores, narcotic use, and complications.
Retrospective review of TAA patients of 2 fellowship-trained orthopedic foot and ankle surgeons was performed. Patients received either preoperative single-shot popliteal sciatic nerve block with 0.2% ropivacaine followed by intraoperative injection of LB or preoperative CPSNB alone. Outcomes examined were visual analog scale (VAS) pain score at 8 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, and 3 weeks following surgery; need for opioid pain medication refill; physician office notification for pain issues or other adverse events; and complications within the first 90 days following surgery. Standard statistical analysis was performed, and P < .05 was considered significant. Seventy-five patients were identified who underwent TAA and met inclusion criteria. Forty-one received LB, and 34 received CPSNB.
No statistical difference was seen between groups with regard to complications, emergency department visits, readmissions, reoperations, VAS pain score at any time point, physician office contacts, and narcotic refills. Sixteen of 41 (39%) LB patients had narcotic refills, versus 12 of 34 (35%) CPSNB patients ( P = .81).

The goal of this study was to report the midterm clinical results of one of the largest cohort of patients in the United States who underwent ankle replacement with this prosthesis.
This is a review of patients with a minimum of 5 years up to 10 years' follow-up. At the preoperative visit and each annual assessment, patients rated their current level of pain using the visual analog score (VAS) and reported their functional level using the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores, the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health survey. These scores were analyzed to assess differences between their levels preoperatively, 1 year postoperatively, and at their most recent follow-up. Criteria for failure was defined as revision requiring exchange or removal of the metallic components for any reason. We identified 106 patients having a Salto Talaris total ankle replacement. Seventy-two patients (mean age, 61.9 years) met the minimum requirement for follow-up (range 60-115 months, mean 81.1 months).
Significant improvements were seen in the VAS, SMFA, AOFAS score, and SF-36 from preoperatively to their final follow-up ( P < .001).

399|28745974|Role of Total Ankle Arthroplasty in Stiff Ankles.|['ankle arthritis', 'arthroplasty', 'gait studies', 'outcome studies']|Foot & ankle international|"The decision tree for the operative treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis involves either ankle arthrodesis (AA) or total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). Although both have documented success providing diminished pain, improved patient-centered outcomes, and improved objective measures of function, arthroplasty is unique in its ability to preserve motion at the tibiotalar joint. Arthroplasty procedures are normally thought of as a motion-sparing surgery rather than a motion-producing procedure, which may limit its success in patients with stiff ankles. Our hypothesis was that there would be improvements in parameters of gait even in patients with a low degree of preoperative total sagittal range of motion.
A retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty with greater than 1-year follow-up. Seventy-six patients were available who underwent isolated TAA for end-stage ankle arthritis with greater than 1-year follow-up. Patient demographics and preoperative and postoperative gait analyses were evaluated. Using a linear regression model, the effect sizes for the variables of age, gender, BMI, preoperative diagnosis, and preoperative total sagittal range of motion were calculated. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the influence each individual variable had on the many parameters of preoperative gait, postoperative gait, and change in gait after surgery. A post hoc analysis was conducted in which patients were divided into 4 quartiles according to preoperative range of motion. A 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare improvement in parameters of gait for the 4 subgroups.
Although a greater degree of preoperative sagittal range of motion was predictive of greater postoperative sagittal range of motion, patients with limited preoperative range of motion experienced a greater overall improvement in range of motion, and clinically meaningful absolute improvements in range of motion, and other parameters of gait. The post hoc analysis demonstrated that patients in the lowest quartile of preoperative motion had both statistically and clinically significant greater improvements across numerous parameters of gait, although the absolute values were lower than in the patients with higher preoperative ROM. Age, gender, BMI, and preoperative diagnosis did not correlate with changes in parameters of gait after total ankle arthroplasty.
Preoperative range of motion was predictive of overall postoperative gait function. On one hand, a low preoperative range of motion resulted in a lower absolute postoperative function. On the other hand, patients with stiff ankles preoperatively had a statistically and clinically greater improvement in function as measured by multiple parameters of gait. This suggests that total ankle arthroplasty can offer clinically meaningful improvement in gait function and should be considered for patients with end-stage tibiotalar arthritis even in the setting of limited sagittal range of motion.

The most recent CHEST guidelines recommended against the use of chemoprophylaxis and the majority of the literature has found a low incidence of VTE following foot and ankle surgery. Some authors prefer screening patients for risk factors and recommend the use of chemoprophylaxis on a case-by-case basis. Interestingly, studies that found high incidence of VTE were unable to determine a statistically significant difference between the prophylaxis and placebo groups. Major limitations of retrospective reviews is they are only able to study symptomatic VTE because no routine screening is typically performed. In a survey study, up to 98% of foot and ankle surgeons responded that they use prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Despite evidence-based recommendations, a significant number of foot and ankle surgeons are routinely using some form of VTE prophylaxis without taking risk factors into account.

Given rising costs and declining reimbursements, identifying variables increasing length of stay (LOS) and total inpatient charges (TICs) of TAA is necessary for providing cost-effective care. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was reviewed between 1993 and 2010, identifying LOS and TIC for TAA. Using a multivariate analysis, patient comorbidities, demographics, payment, and hospital details were evaluated. Median LOS decreased from 5 to 2 days, whereas median TICs increased from $21 382.53 to $62 028.00. Regionally, the South and Midwest had decreased TICs, whereas the West had an increased TIC. There was no significant difference in LOS geographically. Rural hospitals demonstrated decreased TICs, whereas urban private hospitals showed decreased LOS and decreased TICs. Large hospitals were associated with increased LOS and TICs. Compared with Medicare, private insurers demonstrated decreased LOS with equivalent TICs. Diabetics significantly increased mean LOS by 1 day, without a significantly increased TIC. Despite a decreased LOS, hospital charges have increased between 1993 and 2010 in TAA. We found that regional differences and hospital characteristics were associated with differences in LOS and TICs. Identification of these factors provides important information to facilities and surgeons.

Different operative approaches for resecting the tibia and talus impact the bony support for the prostheses due to variations in both bone density and resection area, and may therefore impact loosening performance.
Computed tomography data from 116 subjects were obtained, and solid models of the talus and tibia were generated. Bone density, resection area, and bony support were measured on a series of flat resections for each subject, at multiple resection depths. Similar measurements were performed using a series of subject-specific, anatomic radius-based resections (""round resections"") at multiple depths. Results were compared to assess the impact of both resection type (flat vs round) and resection depth (6-16 mm for the tibia, 2-6 mm for the talus) on bony support.
Statistically significant decreases in bony support for both the talus and the tibia were obtained for flat resections as compared to round resections. A decrease of 8% to 19% for the tibia was seen for all resection depths; a decrease of 8% to 46% for the talus was seen, with greater decreases seen for shallower flat-cut resections.
Bony support in total ankle arthroplasty may be decreased using flat resections compared to round resections at comparable resection depths. Estimated differences are resection-level dependent and different for the distal tibia vs the proximal talus.

The objectives of this retrospective cohort study were 2-fold: (1) to examine the AOS instrument using psychometric analysis and (2) to revise the questions on the AOS to improve the effect of questions on the score and remove redundancies.
Pre- and postoperative patient scores were obtained from AOS questionnaires in the COFAS Prospective Ankle Reconstruction Database, a cohort of patients operatively treated for end-stage ankle arthritis. A split-sample approach was used to evaluate the AOS and to propose a revised instrument.
A total of 380 patients who had been treated with total ankle replacement or ankle arthrodesis were prospectively followed to the 2-year postoperative time point. Correlation analysis demonstrated that a number of questions on the AOS were highly correlated with other similar questions, frequently incomplete, or showed little variation between respondents. Eight of the original AOS questions were retained in the newly proposed Ankle Arthritis Score (AAS) [3 from the AOS Pain subscale and 5 from the AOS Disability subscale]. Principal components analysis (PCA) showed that these questions equally clustered into 2 domains in AAS: Basic Activity and Advanced Activity.

A multicenter, prospective, ankle-reconstruction study enrolled 653 ankles undergoing total ankle replacement (TAR) or ankle arthrodesis (AA). The AAS was given at baseline and annually during postoperative follow-up. Time to revision surgery was modeled using a proportional hazards model. The final sample included 531 ankles in 509 patients.
Sixty-two patients underwent metal-component revision and 8 underwent arthrodesis revision during the follow-up time period. The remaining 461 unrevised ankles (300 TAR, 161 AA) had a minimum follow-up of 2 years (average of 3.4 years). Revision surgery after TAR was found to be associated with a higher postoperative AAS and a longer follow-up. The hazard ratio for the AAS indicated that for every 1-point increase in the score, the rate of revision surgery after TAR was 1 percentage point higher.
TAR patients who reported higher levels of postoperative functional impairment, as indicated by a higher AAS, were more likely to require metal-component revision surgery. After adjustment for other patient factors, the risk of revision surgery increased with length of follow-up after TAR.

A Randomized Trial.|[]|Clinical orthopaedics and related research|"Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is an alternative to arthrodesis, but no randomized trial has examined whether a fixed bearing or mobile bearing implant provides improved gait mechanics.
We wished to determine if fixed- or mobile-bearing TAA results in a larger improvement in pain scores and gait mechanics from before surgery to 1 year after surgery, and to quantify differences in outcomes using statistical analysis and report the standardized effect sizes for such comparisons.
Patients with end-stage ankle arthritis who were scheduled for TAA between November 2011 and June 2013 (n = 40; 16 men, 24 women; average age, 63 years; age range, 35-81 years) were prospectively recruited for this study from a single foot and ankle orthopaedic clinic. During this period, 185 patients underwent TAA, with 144 being eligible to participate in this study. Patients were eligible to participate if they were able to meet all study inclusion criteria, which were: no previous diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, a contralateral TAA, bilateral ankle arthritis, previous revision TAA, an ankle fusion revision, or able to walk without the use of an assistive device, weight less than 250 pounds (114 kg), a sagittal or coronal plane deformity less than 15°, no presence of avascular necrosis of the distal tibia, no current neuropathy, age older than 35 years, no history of a talar neck fracture, or an avascular talus. Of the 144 eligible patients, 40 consented to participate in our randomized trial. These 40 patients were randomly assigned to either the fixed (n = 20) or mobile bearing implant group (n = 20). Walking speed, bilateral peak dorsiflexion angle, peak plantar flexion angle, sagittal plane ankle ROM, peak ankle inversion angle, peak plantar flexion moment, peak plantar flexion power during stance, peak weight acceptance, and propulsive vertical ground reaction force were analyzed during seven self-selected speed level walking trials for 33 participants using an eight-camera motion analysis system and four force plates. Seven patients were not included in the analysis owing to cancelled surgery (one from each group) and five were lost to followup (four with fixed bearing and one with mobile bearing implants). A series of effect-size calculations and two-sample t-tests comparing postoperative and preoperative increases in outcome variables between implant types were used to determine the differences in the magnitude of improvement between the two patient cohorts from before surgery to 1 year after surgery. The sample size in this study enabled us to detect a standardized shift of 1.01 SDs between group means with 80% power and a type I error rate of 5% for all outcome variables in the study.
This randomized trial did not reveal any differences in outcomes between the two implant types under study at the sample size collected. In addition to these results, effect size analysis suggests that changes in outcome differ between implant types by less than 1 SD. Detection of the largest change score or observed effect (propulsive vertical ground reaction force [Fixed: 0.1 ± 0.1; 0.0-1.0; Mobile: 0.0 ± 0.1; 0.0-0.0; p = 0.0.051]) in this study would require a future trial to enroll 66 patients. However, the smallest change score or observed effect (walking speed [Fixed: 0.2 ± 0.3; 0.1-0.4; Mobile: 0.2 ± 0.3; 0.0-0.3; p = 0.742]) requires a sample size of 2336 to detect a significant difference with 80% power at the observed effect sizes.
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study to report the observed effect size comparing improvements in outcome measures between fixed and mobile bearing implant types. This study was statistically powered to detect large effects and descriptively analyze observed effect sizes. Based on our results there were no statistically or clinically meaningful differences between the fixed and mobile bearing implants when examining gait mechanics and pain 1 year after TAA.

We compared postoperative foot segmental motion during gait in patients treated with TAR and AA.
Gait analysis was performed in 17 and 7 patients undergoing TAR and AA, respectively. Subjects were evaluated using a 3-dimensional multisegmental foot model with 15 markers. Temporal gait parameters were calculated. The maximum and minimum values and the differences in hallux, forefoot, hindfoot, and arch in 3 planes (sagittal, coronal, transverse) were compared between the 2 groups. One hundred healthy adults were evaluated as a control.
Gait speed was faster in the TAR ( P = .028). On analysis of foot and ankle segmental motion, the range of hindfoot sagittal motion was significantly greater in the TAR (15.1 vs 10.2 degrees in AA; P = .004). The main component of motion increase was hindfoot dorsiflexion (12.3 and 8.6 degrees). The range of forefoot sagittal motion was greater in the TAR (9.3 vs 5.8 degrees in AA; P = .004). Maximum ankle power in the TAR (1.16) was significantly higher than 0.32 in AA; P = .008). However, the range of hindfoot and forefoot sagittal motion was decreased in both TAR and AA compared with the control group ( P = .000).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate outpatient total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) as compared with overnight or extended inpatient stay, with regard to 90-day medical and operative complications, reoperations, readmissions or emergency room visits, and pain control.
The medical records of patients who underwent TAA with 1 fellowship-trained orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon were reviewed. Outcome measures included operative complications, adverse medical events, readmission or emergency room visit for any reason, or reoperation within 90 days following surgery; surgeon's office contact before first postoperative visit regarding pain or other issues; visual analog scale pain score at the first postoperative visit; and need for narcotic refill. Outcomes were assessed by admission status: outpatient, overnight observation, or inpatient admission. Standard statistical analysis was used, and P < .05 was considered significant.
Eighty-one patients underwent TAA who met inclusion criteria, and 8 had a complication (10%). A significant difference in complication rate was seen among groups ( P = .01) but not rate of readmission or reoperation.

Custom-made implants have recently been used to address these limitations but have lengthy delays between injury and surgery and higher associated costs. A generic talar prosthesis available in various sizes may serve as a suitable alternative.
The geometric variation between shapes of individual tali was determined using 3D geometric models of 91 tali created from CT-scan data. Comparisons were done to determine if tali are one shape. The best shape was determined for each sex, and was compared to determine if a unisex implant would be possible. A geometric template for the implant in multiple sizes was created and compared to the models.
The average of the average deviation between tali after volume scaling was found to be less than 1mm on the main articulating surfaces. One shape group was found for the talus. The female and male tali were found to be similar and a unisex implant template was created.

Elderly patients are the fastest growing segment of the population in the western world, creating a unique challenge to the health economics of our era. Determining if elderly patients with end-stage ankle arthritis demonstrate the same improvements in clinical outcomes and functional measures of gait following TAA would be valuable. This can aid to evaluate the utilization of TAA in this enlarging cohort of our population.
Consecutive series of twenty-one patients over the age of 70, who underwent TAA for end-stage ankle arthritis, was prospectively compared to a series of twenty-one patients aged 50-60, who underwent the same procedure by single surgeon during same time period. Clinical outcomes were measured with outcome scores including VAS pain score, AOFAS Ankle and Hindfoot Score, and the SF-36. Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed preoperatively and at a minimum of one year postoperatively, to measure temporal-spatial, kinematic, and kinetic parameters of gait. Mixed model multivariate statistical analysis was used to evaluate and compare the independent contributions to outcomes of the surgical intervention over time; of patient age; and of time-plus-age interaction, as these influenced both the clinical outcomes and the functional gait outcomes.
Statistically significant improvements in VAS pain scores, AOFAS ankle/hindfoot scores, and SF-36 scores were demonstrated in both age groups. Following surgery, there were improvements in all parameters of gait, including temporal-spatial parameters as step length and walking velocity; kinematic parameters, including, increase in total range of motion to a total of 17-19°; and kinetic parameters, including increase in ankle power and moment. The improvements both in clinical and gait outcomes were equivalent in the two age groups.

Clinically, osteoarthritis is usually characterized by an increasing limitation in dorsal extension of the UAJ with often relatively mild symptoms. In the course of time the full scale of the typical symptoms and the progressive restriction of the global function of the joint develop. Conservative therapy is often able to provide long-term improvement of the symptoms for the majority of patients by means of intermittent analgesics and orthoses as well as shoe modifications. Operative treatment strategies for initial stages are based on joint-sparing methods. The most frequently used therapy for progressive destruction of the UAJ is still arthrodesis. Total ankle replacement is becoming an increasingly more competitive procedure.

427|28552044|Assessing the Utilization of Total Ankle Replacement in the United States.|['ankle arthroplasty', 'cost', 'utilization']|Foot & ankle international|"Total ankle arthroplasty (TAR) has been shown to be a cost-effective procedure relative to conservative management and ankle arthrodesis. Although its use has grown considerably over the last 2 decades, it is less common than arthrodesis. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze the cost and utilization of TAR across hospitals.
Our analytical sample consisted of Medicare claims data from 2011 and 2012 for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals. Outcome variables of interest were the likelihood of a hospital performing TAR, the volume of TAR cases, TAR hospital costs, and hospital profit margins. Data from the 2010 Cost Report and Medicare inpatient claims were utilized to compute average margins for TAR cases and overall hospital margins. TAR cost was calculated based on the all payer cost-to-charge ratio for each hospital in the Cost Report. Nationwide Inpatient Sample data were used to generate descriptive statistics on all TAR patients across payers.
Medicare participants accounted for 47.5% of the overall population of TAR patients. Average implant cost was $13 034, accounting for approximately 70% of the total all-payer cost. Approximately, one-third of hospitals were profitable with respect to primary TAR. Profitable hospitals had lower total costs and higher payments leading to a difference in profit of approximately $11 000 from TAR surgeries between profitable and nonprofitable hospitals. No difference was noted with respect to length of stay or number of cases performed between profitable and nonprofitable hospitals. TAR surgeries were more likely to take place in large and major teaching hospitals. Among hospitals performing at least 1 TAR, the margin on TAR cases was positively associated with the total number of TARs performed by a hospital.
There is an overall significant financial burden associated with performing TAR with many health systems failing to demonstrate profitability despite its increased utilization. While additional factors such as improved patient outcomes may be driving utilization of TAR, financial barriers may exist that can affect utilization of TAR across health systems.

A main source of pain may be an insufficiently balanced ankle. An alternative to the revision of the existing arthroplasty is the use of a corrective osteotomy of the distal tibia, above the stable implant. This strictly extraarticular procedure preserves the integrity of the replaced joint. The aim of this study was to review a series of patients in whom a corrective supramalleolar osteotomy was performed to realign a varus misaligned tibial component in total ankle replacement. We hypothesized that the supramalleolar osteotomy would correct the malpositioned tibial component, resulting in pain relief and improvement of function.
Twenty-two patients (9 male, 13 female; mean age, 62.6 years; range, 44.7-80) were treated with a supramalleolar osteotomy to correct a painful ankle with a varus malpositioned tibial component. Prospectively recorded radiologic and clinical outcome data as well as complications and reoperations were analyzed.
The tibial anterior surface angle significantly changed from 85.2 ± 2.5 degrees preoperatively to 91.4 ± 2.9 degrees postoperatively ( P < .0001), the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot score significantly increased from 46 ± 14 to 66 ± 16 points ( P < .0001) and the patient's pain score measured with the visual analog scale significantly decreased from 5.8 ± 1.9 to 3.3 ± 2.4 ( P < .001). No statistical difference was found in the tibial lateral surface angle and the range of motion of the ankle when comparing the preoperative to the postoperative measurements. The osteotomy healed in all but 3 patients on first attempt. Fifteen patients (68%) were (very) satisfied, 4 moderately satisfied, and 3 patients were not satisfied with the result.
The supramalleolar osteotomy was found to be a reliable treatment option for correcting the varus misaligned tibial component in a painful replaced ankle. However, nonunion (14%) should be mentioned as a possible complication of this surgery. Nonetheless, as a strictly extraarticular procedure, it did not compromise function of the previously replaced ankle, and it was shown to relieve pain without having to have revised a well-fixed ankle arthroplasty.

Although many treatments (total ankle arthroplasty [TAA], ankle fusion [arthrodesis], and ankle distraction arthroplasty) relieve pain, it is not clear that these procedures significantly improve patient mobility. The goal of the research presented here is to summarize what is presently known about lower extremity gait mechanics and outcomes and to quantify the impact of ankle osteoarthritis and TAA have on these measures using an explicitly holistic and mechanistic approach. Our recent studies have explored physical performance and energy recovery and revealed unexpected patterns and sequelae to treatment including incomplete restoration of gait function. These studies demonstrated for the first time the extreme levels and range of gait and balance dysfunction present in ankle osteoarthritis patients as well as quantifying the ways in which the affected joint alters movement and loading patterns not just in the painful joint, but throughout both the ipsilateral and contralateral lower extremity. Through this work, we determined that relieving pain alone through TAA is not enough to restore normal walking mechanics and balance due to underlying causes including limited ankle range of motion and balance deficits leading to long-term disability despite treatment. The results indicate the need to consider additional therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring balance, ankle range of motion, and movement symmetry in order to improve long-term health and function. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Advances in surgical technique and implant design have lead to improved outcomes after both ankle arthrodesis (AA) and total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), yet a clear consensus regarding the most ideal form of treatment is lacking. In this study, the outcomes and complications following AA and TAA are compared in order to improve our understanding and decision-making for care and treatment of symptomatic tibiotalar arthritis.
Studies reporting on outcomes and complications following TAA or AA were obtained for review from the PubMed database between January 2006 and July 2016. Results from studies reporting on a minimum of 200 total ankle arthroplasties or a minimum of 80 ankle arthrodesis procedures were reviewed and pooled for analysis. All studies directly comparing outcomes and complications between TAA and AA were also included for review. Only studies including modern third-generation TAA implants approved for use in the USA (HINTEGRA, STAR, Salto, INBONE) were included.
A total of six studies reporting on outcomes following TAA and five reporting on outcomes following AA met inclusion criteria and were included for pooled data analysis. The adjusted overall complication rate was higher for AA (26.9%) compared to TAA (19.7%), with similar findings in the non-revision reoperation rate (12.9% for AA compared to 9.5% for TAA). The adjusted revision reoperation rate for TAA (7.9%) was higher than AA (5.4%). Analysis of results from ten studies directly comparing TAA to AA suggests a more symmetric gait and less impairment on uneven surfaces after TAA.
Pooled data analysis demonstrated a higher overall complication rate after AA, but a higher reoperation rate for revision after TAA. Based on the existing literature, the decision to proceed with TAA or AA for end-stage ankle arthritis should be made on an individual patient basis."|||A total of six studies reporting on outcomes following TAA and five reporting on outcomes following AA met inclusion criteria and were included for pooled data analysis.

451|28462686|Midterm Outcome of the Agility Total Ankle Arthroplasty.|['arthritis', 'outcome studies', 'total ankle arthroplasty', 'total ankle replacement']|Foot & ankle international|"Ankle arthritis is a debilitating condition that causes severe functional impairment. While arthrodesis has been the gold standard of surgical treatment for this condition, significant improvements in total ankle arthroplasty have made it a viable alternative. The purpose of this study was to look at the midterm follow-up of the Agility total ankle.
A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted on 127 consecutive Agility total ankles implanted between 2002 and 2009. Charts were reviewed to collect patient demographics. In addition, coronal alignment, overall arc of motion, tibiotalar component motion, syndesmotic fusion, zones of osteolysis, and subsidence were determined. A Kaplan-Meier survival and linear regression analysis were used to predict implant failure. A multivariate regression analysis was used to assess whether radiographic measures were predictive of patient satisfaction.
Ninety (78.2%) of 115 patients retained their primary implant, of which 105 were available for evaluation, with an average follow-up of 9.1 years. Twenty-five had their implant removed. The average score for the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) activities of daily living subscale was 82.4, FAAM sport subscale 55.3, postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) for pain 12.7, and Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey physical component 45.8 and SF-12 mental component 56.1. Average arc of motion across the implant was 22.3 and 6.3 degrees in adjacent joints. Osteolysis most commonly occurred in zones 1 and 6. No statistical differences were found in the rate or location of subsidence. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that age at the time of surgery was predictive of failure ( P = .036). Inflammatory and atraumatic arthritis demonstrated higher likelihoods of revision. No correlation was detected between radiographic parameters and outcomes scores ( P > .05; rho >0.2). A significant reduction in mean VAS pain scores by 67.6% was maintained at an average of 8 years.
Our results were improved over the nondesigner outcomes published in the current literature. Survivorship approached 80% at 9 years, with Kaplan-Meier 14-year survival calculated at 70.4%. Patients with their original implant were functioning with a high level of satisfaction based on statistically validated outcome scores, which was independent of the radiographic appearance of their implant. Age at the time of surgery and inflammatory/atraumatic arthritis were predictive of failure.

454|28425054|Can a Three-Component Prosthesis be Used for Conversion of Painful Ankle Arthrodesis to Total Ankle Replacement?|[]|Clinical orthopaedics and related research|"In patients with painful ankle arthrodesis, the surgical treatment is challenging, and may include takedown of ankle arthrodesis and conversion to a total ankle replacement (TAR). This procedure is technically demanding given the altered anatomy after arthrodesis. Few studies have evaluated TAR in the setting of prior arthrodesis.
(1) What intraoperative and perioperative complications were observed in patients who underwent conversion of an ankle arthrodesis to a TAR? (2) Was durable fixation achieved at short term, and what was the alignment of the components? (3) What subsequent surgical procedures were performed, including revisions? (4) What improvements were observed in pain, tibiotalar range of motion (ROM), and quality of life?
Between January 2007 and December 2014, 18 patients with a painful ankle arthrodesis underwent conversion to TAR at our tertiary referral center. During this period, the indications for conversion of ankle arthrodesis to TAR were tibiotalar nonunion or malunion after attempted arthrodesis in patients who declined revision ankle arthrodesis. The goal of revision surgery was to help patients regain hindfoot mobility and to decrease pain. During the study period, all patients who met indications were treated with a conversion procedure. Of the 18 patients included, 14 were men and four were women. The mean age of the patients was 51 ± 7 years. The mean followup was 54 ± 27 months, with no loss to follow up observed. The initial ankle arthrodesis was performed 6 ± 3.5 years before conversion to TAR. In all patients, the conversion to TAR was performed using a nonconstrained cementless three-component prosthesis. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, revision procedures, and prosthesis component loosening were evaluated. Weightbearing radiographs were used to determine the angular alignment of the tibial and talar components using α/β/γ angles and to analyze the bone-implant interface. Osseointegration was defined as visible trabecular structures at the bone-implant interface without radiolucent lines. The criteria for radiographic loosening was defined as subsidence or migration of prosthesis components and/or a cystic lesion with a diameter at least 2 mm. Clinical assessment included pain evaluation, measurement of ankle ROM, and quality of life.
Two of the 18 patients sustained an intraoperative medial malleolar fracture. In three patients, delayed wound healing was observed. At latest followup, four patients had incomplete osseointegration (posterior quarter of the bone-prosthesis interface on the tibial side). None of the 18 patients had prosthesis loosening. In all patients, both components were neutrally aligned. Two patients had painful arthrofibrosis with reduced ROM, which we treated with an open arthrolysis and exchange of mobile-bearing inlay; one other patient is considering a revision for substantial tibial component medial tilt with collapse of the medial arch. At the latest followup, the mean dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 8.5° ± 3° and 15° ± 5°, respectively. The mean visual analog scale (VAS) score decreased from 9 ± 0.8 to 1.7 ± 1.6 (p < 0.001). The Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) physical and mental outcome scores improved from 34 ± 5 to 74 ± 11 (p < 0.001) and from 49 ± 4 to 75.5 ± 7 (p < 0.001).
Conversion of an ankle arthrodesis to a TAR is a technically challenging procedure. In this small series, it was associated with frequent complications including arthrofibrosis, and functional outcomes including postoperative ROM were lower than reported for primary TAR. However, pain and function did improve. Further studies are necessary to address long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes in this patient cohort.

American volume|"This study attempted to identify where motion occurs after total ankle replacement, the difference in range-of-motion contributions between fixed-bearing and mobile-bearing total ankle replacements, and the contribution of abnormal peritalar motion. We hypothesized that sagittal plane radiographic assessment would demonstrate that actual ankle motion through the prosthesis is less than the total arc of ankle motion that may be observed clinically secondary to contributions from adjacent joints.
Patients underwent routine standardized weight-bearing maximum dorsiflexion and plantar flexion sagittal radiographs. Sagittal plane ankle and foot measurements were performed on each dorsiflexion and plantar flexion radiograph to determine the total arc of ankle motion, actual ankle motion through the prosthesis, motion through the subtalar and talonavicular joints, and midfoot motion. Motion radiographs were routinely made at 1 year postoperatively and at the time of the most recent follow-up. A minimum follow-up of 2 years was required of all patients.
There were 197 patients who met the inclusion criteria (75 INBONE, 52 Salto Talaris, and 70 STAR prostheses). The mean time to the latest radiographs (and standard deviation) was 42.9 ± 18.8 months. The mean actual ankle motion through the prosthesis was 25.9° ± 12.2°, which was significantly less (p < 0.001) than the mean total motion arc of 37.6° ± 12.0°. The motion of the ankle accounted for 68% of total range of motion, and motion of the peritalar joints accounted for 32%. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the 3 prostheses or when comparing fixed and mobile-bearing designs for both ranges of motion.
This study demonstrates that actual ankle motion after total ankle replacement is approximately 12° less than the total arc of motion that might be observed clinically because of increased midfoot and subtalar motion.

457|28367692|Operative Wound Complications Following Total Ankle Arthroplasty.|['total ankle arthroplasty', 'wound management']|Foot & ankle international|"Wound complications following total ankle replacement (TAR) potentially lead to devastating consequences. The aim of this study was to compare the operative and demographic differences in patients with and without major wound problems which required operative management. We hypothesized that increased tourniquet and operative time would negatively influence wound healing.
We identified a consecutive series of 762 primary TARs performed between December 1999 and April 2014 whose data were prospectively collected. We then identified the subset of patients who required a secondary surgery to treat major wound complications (ie, operative debridement, split-thickness skin grafting, and soft tissue reconstruction). All patients requiring a second surgery had operative wound debridement. We then compared the demographics, operative characteristics, and functional scores to see if any differences existed between patients with and without major wound complications. Clinical outcomes including secondary procedures and implant failure rates were recorded.
Twenty-six patients (3.4%) had a total of 49 operative procedures to treat major wound issues. Eighteen patients had flaps and 14 had split-thickness skin grafts. The median time to operatively treating the wound was 1.9 (range: 0.5-12.5) months after the index TAR. The median follow-up time from the wound procedure was 12.7 (range: 1.2-170.8) months. Compared to the control group, patients with major wounds had a significantly longer mean surgery (214.8 vs 189.3 minutes, P = .041) time and trended toward a longer median tourniquet time (151 vs 141 minutes, P = .060). Patients without wound complications were more likely to have posttraumatic arthritis, whereas those with wound complications were more likely to have primary osteoarthritis ( P = .006). The control group trended toward having a higher mean BMI (29.5 vs 27.2, P = .056). There were 6 failures in the major wound complication cohort (23.1%), including 2 below the knee amputations.
Ankle wounds that required operative management had high failure rates and some resulted in devastating outcomes. We did not find any increase in major wound complications in those with various risk factors as identified by other studies. Given our data, we recommend limiting operative time. While correcting hindfoot and midfoot alignment is important for improving patient functionality and survivorship of the implant, thought should be given to staging the TAR if multiple pathologies are to be addressed at the time of surgery to limit operative time.

A total of 57 pathology samples were identified in the osteolysis group, while 11 were identified in the control group. For each sample, hematoxylin and eosin, Oil Red O (ORO), and macrophage marker CD163-stained slides were created. Polarized light and ORO stain were used to identify PE particles. The presence of metal particles and giant cell reaction to PE particles were also scored.
Macrophages, PE particles, metallosis, and foreign body giant cell reaction scores were significantly higher in the osteolysis group compared with the control group. In the osteolysis group, ORO staining was positive in 93% (53/57), birefringent material was present in 96.5% (55/57), and macrophage infiltrates were present in 96.5% (55/57).

The aim of this study was to determine intraoperative and postoperative complications and evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of TAR in patients with haemophilic arthropathy.
Fourteen patients with a mean age of 51.4 ± 10.2 years (range = 32.9-63.7) were treated for end-stage haemophilic ankle arthropathy. Nine procedures were primary arthroplasties, five procedures were conversions of painful ankle arthrodesis to TAR. The mean duration of follow-up was 5.8 ± 2.3 years (range = 2.0-9.2). Component stability and alignment was assessed with weight-bearing radiographs. Clinical assessment was performed.
One patient sustained an intraoperative medial malleolar fracture. In two patients, delayed wound healing was observed. In one patient, open arthrolysis was performed due to painful arthrofibrosis. Both components were neutrally aligned. Visual analogue scale (VAS) significantly decreased from 8.5 ± 0.9 (range = 8-10) to 1.3 ± 1.6 (range = 0-6). Significant functional improvement including range of motion (ROM) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score was observed. The summarized components of the SF-36 physical and mental outcomes score significantly improved at the latest follow-up. Complication rates and clinical/radiographic outcomes were comparable in patients with primary TAR and conversion of ankle arthrodesis to TAR.

464|28196041|Change in Talar Translation in the Coronal Plane After Mobile-Bearing Total Ankle Replacement and Its Association with Lower-Limb and Hindfoot Alignment.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Mobile-bearing total ankle replacement (TAR) enables motion at the tibial implant-polyethylene insert interface. This motion could lead to coronal translation of the talus relative to the tibia and may affect radiographic outcome. We aimed to assess the translation of the talus before and after mobile-bearing TAR to determine whether translation of the talus after TAR is associated with coronal plane alignment of the lower limb and hindfoot as well as to investigate the complications associated with talar translation.
In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 153 patients (159 ankles) with a minimum follow-up of 3 years who underwent mobile-bearing TAR. The location of the talus in the coronal plane was quantified with use of talar center migration (TCM) on anteroposterior radiographs both preoperatively and at postoperative intervals, and the relationship between them was investigated. Radiographic parameters in the coronal plane-including mechanical axis deviation (MAD), lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA), hindfoot alignment angle, and hindfoot moment arm-were measured. The relationship between TCM and radiographic parameters in the coronal plane was assessed in each group. The complications associated with talar translation were examined during the same period.
During the 36-month follow-up period, the postoperative TCM showed a strong relationship with the preoperative TCM. Moreover, MAD, LDTA, and hindfoot alignment were significantly related to talar translation (p < 0.01). Complications included medial malleolar impingement in 5 cases (including delayed medial malleolar fracture due to medial impingement in 2 cases), insert dislocation in 1 case, and edge-loading in 2 cases; all of the cases with complications demonstrated implant overhang with talar translation.
Talar translation in the coronal plane after mobile-bearing TAR correlates with the preoperative talar translation. Talar translation arises from deformities of MAD, LDTA, and hindfoot alignment, and it may be accompanied by various complications, as observed on coronal radiography. Therefore, additional realignment procedures for coronal malalignment should be considered to prevent talar translation after mobile-bearing TAR.

American volume|"There are several types of prostheses available to surgeons when performing a total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). The main objective of this study was to summarize the clinical and functional outcomes of 4 TAA prostheses: the Hintegra implant (Integra LifeSciences), the Agility implant (DePuy), the Mobility implant (DePuy), and the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) implant (Small Bone Innovations [SBi]).
Patients were prospectively recruited. A total of 451 TAAs with a mean follow-up (and standard deviation) of 4.5 ± 2.0 years were included. Patients were assessed annually and completed self-reported outcome measures at these visits. Complications and revisions were reported at the time of incident. Mean improvements are reported by prosthesis. Linear mixed-effects models were used to obtain adjusted comparisons of scores across prostheses. Survivorship curves were generated by prosthesis and type of complication.
Mean improvement in the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) total score was less among patients with the Mobility implant (19.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15 to 24) than it was among patients with the Agility implant (29.1; 95% CI, 24 to 34), Hintegra implant (29.7; 95% CI, 27 to 33), and STAR implant (28.5; 95% CI, 23 to 34). Patients in the Mobility group also had less mean improvement in the AOS pain score (21.3; 95% CI, 17 to 26) compared with patients in the Hintegra (29.0; 95% CI, 26 to 32), Agility (29.8; 95% CI, 25 to 35), and STAR (29.1; 95% CI, 23 to 35) groups. The Mobility group also had less mean improvement in the AOS disability score (17.3; 95% CI, 12 to 23) compared with the Hintegra (30.4; 95% CI, 27 to 34), Agility (28.8; 95% CI, 23 to 34), and STAR (27.8; 95% CI, 21 to 34) groups. Survival results among the 4 prostheses are reported.
This study demonstrated acceptable outcomes of 4 modern TAA prostheses.

Physiotherapy continues to be an extremely important part of TAR and has a tremendous impact on the outcomes of this procedure. Given the lack of data on the latter, this study details a protocol of perioperative physiotherapy in TAR in patients with inherited bleeding disorders (IBD). The protocol outlined in this paper was devised via consultations within an interdisciplinary group, the authors' own experiences with TAR in hemophilic and non-hemophilic patients, previous reports on this issue in the literature, and patient opinions. Our working group followed the criteria of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The algorithm includes 4 physiotherapy phases with specified time frames, aims, interventions, and examples of exercises for each phase. We emphasize the importance of preoperative rehabilitation, and recommend introducing intensive physiotherapy immediately after the surgery, with regard to the wound protection and avoiding full weight-bearing in the first weeks. The intensity of physiotherapy should be adjusted individually depending on individual patient progress. This study details a rehabilitation protocol for TAR in patients with IBDs, which can be equally applicable to clinicians and researchers. Further scientific studies are required to investigate the beneficial effect of different protocols as well as to clarify the effectiveness of various frequencies, durations, and intensities of selected interventions.|||||10.12659/msm.898075|2017-01-28|[{'lastname': 'Kotela', 'firstname': 'Andrzej', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of the Musculoskeletal System, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.\nDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Interior, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilk-Frańczuk', 'firstname': 'Magdalena', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiotherapy and Manual Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Vincent Pol University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Jaczewska', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, Lekmed Medical Center, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Żbikowski', 'firstname': 'Piotr', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Interior, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Łęgosz', 'firstname': 'Paweł', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of the Musculoskeletal System, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ambroziak', 'firstname': 'Paweł', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Interior, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kotela', 'firstname': 'Ireneusz', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Interior, Warsaw, Poland.\nDepartment of Physiotherapy, Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.'}]

American volume|"We performed a retrospective cohort study to compare preoperative health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between patients with bilateral and those with unilateral end-stage ankle arthritis. We also compared midterm outcomes in a subgroup of patients who had undergone staged bilateral total ankle replacement (TAR) with the outcomes in the group treated with unilateral TAR.
The HRQoL before surgical treatment was compared between 53 patients with bilateral end-stage ankle arthritis identified from the Canadian Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Prospective Ankle Reconstruction Database and 106 patients with unilateral arthritis selected from the same database. Short Form-36 (SF-36) and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Foot and Ankle Module (AAOS-FAM) scores were used to assess preoperative HRQoL. Midterm outcomes (implant survival, HRQoL, and reoperation and revision rates) were compared between 37 patients who had undergone staged bilateral TAR and 106 patients treated with unilateral TAR; all patients were followed for at least 2 years.
Preoperatively, patients with unilateral disease had a higher prevalence of posttraumatic arthritis, whereas patients with bilateral disease had a higher prevalence of primary and secondary arthritis (p < 0.001). The mean preoperative SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) score in the unilateral group was higher than that in the bilateral group (p < 0.002). The mean postoperative follow-up (and standard deviation) was 5.0 ± 2.0 years in the bilateral TAR group and 4.0 ± 1.8 years in the unilateral TAR group. The patients who underwent either unilateral or staged bilateral TAR demonstrated improved SF-36 PCS scores between the preoperative and postoperative evaluations (p < 0.001). The postoperative SF-36 PCS scores were similar between the patients with unilateral TAR and those with bilateral TAR (p = 0.70). Six ankles (6%) in the unilateral cohort and 6 ankles (8%) in the bilateral cohort required revision of the metal component (p = 0.52). The mean implant survival time was 10.9 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.1 to 11.7 years) in the bilateral cohort and 9.2 years (95% CI = 8.5 to 9.8 years) in the unilateral cohort (p = 0.60).
Preoperative SF-36 scores demonstrated that bilateral end-stage ankle arthritis is a more debilitating condition than unilateral arthritis. Patients who underwent staged bilateral TAR benefited as much as patients who underwent unilateral TAR, despite having a worse preoperative health status. Metal component revision rates and implant survival were similar between the 2 groups.

Therefore, we quantitatively and qualitatively assessed the effects of ETL on metal artifact on MRI scans using a cobalt-chromium-containing arthroplasty implant system.
Using a total ankle arthroplasty system implanted into a human cadaver ankle and a clinical 1.5 T MRI system, turbo spin echo (TSE) pulse sequences were acquired with ETL ranging from 3 to 23 and receiver bandwidth (BW) from 100 to 750 Hz/pixel, whereas effective echo time and spatial resolution were controlled. A compressed sensing slice encoding for metal artifact correction TSE prototype pulse sequence was used as reference standard. End points included the total implant-related artifact area and implant-related signal void areas. Two raters evaluated the overall image quality and preference across varying BW and ETL. Two-factor analysis of variance, Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Pearson correlation were used. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
The total implant-related artifact area ranged from 0.119 for compressed sensing slice encoding for metal artifact correction (BW, 600 Hz/pixel; ETL, 3) to 0.265 for TSE (BW, 100 Hz/pixel; ETL, 23). Longer ETL significantly increases the total implant-related artifact area (P = 0.0004), whereas it decreased with increasing BW (P < 0.0001). Implant-related signal void areas were not significantly affected by larger echo train length, but reduced with higher BW (P < 0.0001). Readers had a significant preference for images with high BW and short ETL (P < 0.0001).
High receiver BW is the most effective parameter for reduction of arthroplasty implant-induced metal artifact on MRI scans, whereas in contradiction to prevalent notions, long echo trains fail to reduce implant-related metal artifacts, but in fact cause degradation of image quality around the implant with resultant larger appearing total metal artifacts."|||The total implant-related artifact area ranged from 0.119 for compressed sensing slice encoding for metal artifact correction (BW, 600 Hz/pixel; ETL, 3) to 0.265 for TSE (BW, 100 Hz/pixel; ETL, 23).

The feasibility of outpatient total ankle arthroplasty (OTAA) has not been reported in the literature. We sought to establish proof of concept for OTAA by comparing outpatient vs inpatient perioperative complications, postoperative emergency department (ED) visits, readmissions, patient satisfaction, and cost analysis.
From July 2010 to September 2015, a total of 36 patients underwent TAA. Patients with prior ankle replacement, prior ankle infections, neuroarthropathy, or osteonecrosis of the talus were excluded from the study. All patient demographics, tourniquet times, estimated blood loss, comorbidities, concomitant procedures, complications, return ED visits, and readmissions were recorded. Patient satisfaction questionnaires were collected. Twenty-one patients had outpatient surgery and 15 had inpatient surgery. The cohorts were matched demographically.
The average length of stay for the inpatient group was 2.5 days. The overall cost differential between the groups was 13.4%, with the outpatient group being less costly. This correlates to a cost savings of nearly $2500 per case. One patient in the outpatient group had a return ED visit on postoperative day 1 for urinary retention. There were no 30-day readmissions in either group. Seventy-one percent of the outpatient group and 93% of the inpatient group would not change to a different postoperative admission status if they were to have the procedure again.
Our results show that OTAA was a cost-effective and safe alternative with low complication rates and high patient satisfaction. With proper patient selection, OTAA was beneficial to both the patient and the health care system by driving down total cost. It has the capacity to generate substantial savings while providing equal or better value to the patient.

The aims of this study were the application and modification of the consensus classification of the synovia-like interface membrane (SLIM) for periprosthetic failure of the ankle joint, the etiological clarification of periprosthetic pseudocysts and a detailed measurement of proliferative activity (Ki67) in the region of osteolysis.
Tissue samples from 159 patients were examined according to the criteria of the standardized consensus classification. Of these, 117 cases were derived from periprosthetic membranes of the ankle. The control group included 42 tissue specimens from the hip and knee joints. Particle identification and characterization were carried out using the particle algorithm. An immunohistochemical examination with Ki67 proliferation was performed in all cases of ankle pseudocysts and 19 control cases.
The consensus classification of SLIM is transferrable to endoprosthetic failure of the ankle joint. Periprosthetic pseudocysts with the histopathological characteristics of the appropriate SLIM subtype were detectable in 39 cases of ankle joint endoprostheses (33.3%). The mean value of the Ki67 index was 14% and showed an increased proliferation rate in periprosthetic pseudocysts of the ankle (p-value 0.02037).
In periprosthetic pseudocysts an above average higher detection rate of type 1 SLIM induced by abrasion (51.3%) with an increased Ki67 proliferation fraction (p-value 0.02037) was found, which can be interpreted as local destructive intraosseus synovialitis. This can be the reason for formation of pseudocystic osteolysis caused by high mechanical stress in ankle endoprostheses.

American volume|"In recent years, the number of total ankle arthroplasty procedures performed has increased dramatically. We sought to report the clinical results of the largest cohort of patients treated with a modern fixed-bearing total ankle arthroplasty by a single surgeon.
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 78 consecutive patients (81 ankles) who underwent total ankle arthroplasty with a minimum clinical follow-up of 2 years. Sixty-three patients completed standardized questionnaires including the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI), the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), the Short Form (SF)-36v2, and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. In addition, each patient underwent serial range-of-motion examination and radiographic implant evaluation at each follow-up appointment.
Implant survival was 97.5% at a mean follow-up time of 5.2 years. There was 1 revision of a tibial component and 1 revision of a talar component. Thirty-six patients underwent a concurrent procedure at the time of the index surgery, with the most common being removal of previous hardware. Seventeen patients underwent additional procedures following the index surgery, with the most common being gutter debridement. Total range of motion averaged 35.5° preoperatively and 39.9° postoperatively (p = 0.02). Fifty-seven ankles (70%) had >2 years of radiographic follow-up, and 25 ankles (31%) displayed evidence of lucency around a metallic component at the final radiographic follow-up. Outcome scores at a mean of 5.2 years revealed promising results for the cohort, with a mean VAS pain score of 17.7 and a mean FADI score of 79.1.

When concurrent subtalar joint pathologic features exist, ipsilateral subtalar joint arthrodesis (STJA) can be performed either simultaneous with TAR or as a staged procedure. Limited data exist on the effect of talar component subsidence and prosthesis survivorship. The present study purpose was to evaluate the effect of STJA on talar component subsidence after primary TAR and its effect on TAR survivorship. All patients, a minimum of 18 years old, from a single institution with modern-generation TAR and 1-year minimum follow-up data available were evaluated. The study group included patients who had also undergone STJA, and the control group (no STJA) was matched 1:1 by age, gender, and prosthesis. The initial postoperative weightbearing and most recent weightbearing radiographs were compared for talar component subsidence. We reviewed 399 primary TARs from 2004 to 2012. A total of 33 patients with ipsilateral STJA met the inclusion criteria and had an appropriate control group match. In the study group, 8 patients required a return to the operating room for 4 revisions and 4 reoperations at a median follow-up point of 24.3 months. Of the controls, 9 patients required a return to the operating room, with 4 revisions and 5 reoperations at a median follow-up point of 38.4 months. No statistically significant radiographic differences were found between the 2 groups. Primary TAR and ipsilateral STJA were infrequently required (41 of 399; 10.3%). TAR did not result in decreased survivorship when performed with ipsilateral STJA at an early follow-up point. Further study is warranted to determine any differences among previous, simultaneous, and subsequent STJA with ipsilateral TAR, and a matched longitudinal analysis is needed to determine longer term survivorship.||||Copyright © 2016 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

System instrumentation for total ankle arthroplasty implantation has a key influence on surgeon accuracy and reproducibility. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy and reproducibility of implant position with patient-specific guides for total ankle arthroplasty across multiple surgeons at multiple facilities.
This retrospective, multicenter study included 44 patients who received a total ankle implant (INBONE II Total Ankle System; Wright Medical Technology, Memphis, TN) using PROPHECY patient-specific guides from January 2012 to December 2014. Forty-four patients with an average age of 63.0 years underwent total ankle arthroplasty using this preoperative patient-specific system. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained to assess coronal plane deformity, assess mechanical and anatomic alignment, and build patient-specific guides that referenced bony anatomy. The mean preoperative coronal deformity was 4.6 ± 4.6 degrees (range, 14 degrees varus to 17 degrees valgus). The first postoperative weightbearing radiographs were used to measure coronal and sagittal alignment of the implant vs the anatomic axis of the tibia.
In 79.5% of patients, the postoperative implant position of the tibia corresponded to the preoperative plan of the tibia within 3 degrees of the intended target, within 4 degrees in 88.6% of patients, and within 5 degrees in 100% of patients. The tibial component coronal size was correctly predicted in 98% of cases, whereas the talar component was correctly predicted in 80% of cases.
The use of patient-specific instrumentation for total ankle arthroplasty provided reliable alignment and reproducibility in the clinical situation similar to that shown in cadaveric testing. This study has shown that the preoperative patient-specific instrumentation provided for accuracy and reproducibility of ankle arthroplasty implantation in a cohort across multiple surgeons and facilities.

Future reoperations might be avoided if the cause is recognized and procedures or devices modified accordingly. Reoperations result in costs to both patient and the health care system. This paper proposes a new classification system for reoperations in end-stage ankle arthritis, and analyzes reoperation rates for ankle joint replacement and arthrodesis surgeries from a multicenter database.
A total of 213 ankle arthrodeses and 474 total ankle replacements were prospectively followed from 2002 to 2010. Reoperations were identified as part of the prospective cohort study. Operating reports were reviewed, and each reoperation was coded. To verify inter- and intraobserver reliability of this new coding system, 6 surgeons experienced in foot and ankle surgery were asked to assign a specific code to 62 blinded reoperations, on 2 separate occasions. Reliability was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and proportions of agreement.
Of a total of 687 procedures, 74.8% (514/687) required no reoperation (Code 1). By surgery type, 14.1% (30/213) of ankle arthrodesis procedures and 30.2% (143/474) of ankle replacement procedures required reoperation. The rate for reoperations surrounding the ankle joint (ie, Codes 2 and 3) was 9.9% (21/213) for ankle arthrodesis versus 5.9% for ankle replacement (28/474). Reoperation rates within the ankle joint (ie, Codes 4 to 10) were 4.7% (10/213) for ankle arthrodesis and 26.1% (124/474) for ankle replacement. Overall, 0.9% (2/213) of arthrodesis procedures required reoperation outside the initial operative site (Code 3), versus 4.6% (22/474) for total ankle replacement. The rate of reoperation due to deep infection (Code 7) was 0.9% (2/213) for arthrodesis versus 2.3% (11/474) for ankle replacement. Interobserver reliability testing produced a mean ICC of 0.89 on the first read. The mean ICC for intraobserver reliability was 0.92. For interobserver, there was 87.9% agreement (804/915) on the first read, and 87.5% agreement (801/915) on the second. For the intra observer readings, 88.5% (324/366) were in agreement.
The new coding system presented here was reliable and may provide a more standardized, clinically useful framework for assessing reoperation rates and resource utilization than prior complication- and diagnosis-based classification systems, such as modifications of the Clavien Dindo System. Analyzing reoperations at the primary site may enable a better understanding of reasons for failure, and may therefore improve the outcomes of surgery in the future.

The purpose of this study is to (1) determine the extent of TAA regionalization, as well as examine the growth of TAA performed at high-, medium-, and low-volume New York State institutions and (2) compare this regionalization and growth with AF.
The New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) administrative data were used to identify 737 primary TAA and 7453 AF from 2005 to 2014. The volume of TAA and AF surgery in New York State was mapped according to patient and hospital 3-digit zip code.
The number of TAA per year grew 1500% (from 11 to 177) from 2005 to 2014, while there was a 35.6% reduction (from 895 to 576) in yearly AF procedures. TAA recipients were widely distributed throughout the state, while TAA procedures were regionalized to a few select metropolitan centers. AF procedures were performed more uniformly than TAA. The number of TAA has continued to increase at high- (15 to 91) and medium-volume (14 to 67) institutions where it has decreased at low-volume institutions (44 to 19).
The increased utilization of TAA is attributed to relatively few high-volume centers located in major metropolitan centers.

The aim of this epidemiological study, using a national inpatient database in Japan, was to describe the volume, utilization, patient characteristics, and temporal trends regarding these procedures in Japan, and to identify the risk factors associated with perioperative adverse events in TAA.
This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study. We retrospectively identified 2775 patients in the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database who underwent ankle arthrodesis or TAA for ankle arthritis at 559 hospitals in Japan from 2007 to 2013. Information on sex, age, main diagnosis, use of blood transfusion, duration of anesthesia, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, hospitalization costs, additional procedures after primary surgery, and use of negative pressure wound therapy was extracted. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the effect of various factors on the incidence of perioperative adverse events in TAA, including additional procedure during hospitalization, negative pressure wound therapy, blood transfusion, and in-hospital death.
We identified 465 patients who underwent TAA and 2310 patients who underwent ankle arthrodesis. There was no apparent increase in the proportion of TAAs performed during the survey period. Patients undergoing TAA tended to be older, female, and have rheumatoid arthritis compared with those undergoing ankle arthrodesis. Patients undergoing TAA had shorter length of stay, higher hospitalization costs, and more blood transfusions compared with those undergoing ankle arthrodesis. Lower hospital volume and shorter anesthesia time were associated with higher rates of adverse events after TAA.
Despite an increase in the popularity of TAA internationally, the number of TAAs performed remains low in Japan. Lower hospital volume and anesthesia time were associated with higher rates of perioperative adverse events after TAA.

The purpose of our study was to assess the effect of insurance and other demographic factors on the operative management of tibiotalar osteoarthritis.
The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify patients who underwent a total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) or tibiotalar arthrodesis (TTA) for tibiotalar osteoarthritis. Insurance status was identified for each patient, and the proportions of each insurance type were computed for each operative modality. A multivariate analysis was performed to account for confounding variables to isolate the effect of insurance type on operative treatment.
From 2007 to 2012, a total of 10 010 patients (35.6%) were identified who underwent a total ankle replacement (TAR) procedure and 18 094 patients (64.4%%) who underwent TTA for tibiotalar osteoarthritis. Patients receiving a TAR were older (65.8 vs 64.2, P < .001), more likely to be female (54% vs 51%, P < .001), and had fewer comorbidities (4.2 vs 4.5, P < .001) than patients who underwent a TTA. After controlling for baseline differences, patients with Medicare (odds ratio [OR] 3.00, P < .001), and private insurance (OR 3.19, P < .001) were approximately 3 times more likely to undergo TAR than patients with Medicaid.

We quantified correlations between patient-reported measures and physical performance tests in patients after TAA to determine the usefulness of physical performance tests in post-TAA assessment.
In total, 140 patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis were assessed prior to TAA and again at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. At each time point, the visual analog scale (VAS), Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI), American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS), Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), and Short-Form 36 (SF-36) scores were collected, as well as walking speed, Four-Square Step Test (FSST) times, and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) balance scores.
All but 1 (SF-36 general health component) of the patient-reported outcomes improved significantly from preoperative assessment to both 1 and 2 years postoperatively ( P < .001 in all cases). Walking speed, FSST times, and balance scores improved significantly across time ( P < .001 in all cases).

Recent adoption of patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) allows for referencing to be determined preoperatively, resulting in less steps and potentially decreased operative time. We hypothesized that usage of PSI would result in decreased operating room time that would offset the additional cost of PSI compared with standard referencing (SR). In addition, we aimed to compare postoperative radiographic alignment between PSI and SR.
Between August 2014 and September 2015, 87 patients undergoing TAR were enrolled in a prospectively collected TAR database. Patients were divided into cohorts based on PSI vs SR, and operative times were reviewed. Radiographic alignment parameters were retrospectively measured at 6 weeks postoperatively. Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) was used to derive direct costs. Cost vs operative time-savings were examined via 2-way sensitivity analysis to determine cost-saving thresholds for PSI applicable to a range of institution types. Cost-saving thresholds defined the price of PSI below which PSI would be cost-saving. A total of 35 PSI and 52 SR cases were evaluated with no significant differences identified in patient characteristics.
Operative time from incision to completion of casting in cases without adjunct procedures was 127 minutes with PSI and 161 minutes with SR ( P < .05). PSI demonstrated similar postoperative accuracy to SR in coronal tibial-plafond alignment (1.1 vs 0.3 degrees varus, P = .06), tibial-plafond alignment (0.3 ± 2.1 vs 1.1 ± 2.1 degrees varus, P = .06), and tibial component sagittal alignment (0.7 vs 0.9 degrees plantarflexion, P = .14). The TDABC method estimated a PSI cost-savings threshold range at our institution of $863 below which PSI pricing would provide net cost-savings. Two-way sensitivity analysis generated a globally applicable cost-savings threshold model based on institution-specific costs and surgeon-specific time-savings.
This study demonstrated equivalent postoperative TAR alignment with PSI and SR referencing systems but with a significant decrease in operative time with PSI. Based on TDABC and associated sensitivity analysis, a cost-savings threshold of $863 was identified for PSI pricing at our institution below which PSI was less costly than SR. Similar internal cost accounting may benefit health care systems for identifying cost drivers and obtaining leverage during price negotiations.

American volume|"This study provides an updated comparison of the reoperation rates following primary ankle arthrodesis and total ankle replacement on the basis of observational, population-based data from California. We previously reported data from 1995 to 2004, and our current study includes new data from 2005 to 2010. Our hypothesis was that total ankle replacement would demonstrate increasing utilization and lower complication rates given advances in implant design and growth in surgeon experience.
California's hospital discharge database was used to identify patients who had undergone primary ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement between 1995 and 2010. Short-term outcomes examined were based on Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) surgical quality measures and included readmission for any cause, death, and readmission for 7 common surgical complications (acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, mechanical complications, surgical-site bleeding, and periprosthetic joint infection or wound infection). Long-term outcomes analyzed included rates of major revision surgery (ankle arthrodesis or ankle replacement, adjacent joint procedures (subtalar arthrodesis, triple arthrodesis, tarsometatarsal arthrodesis, and total knee replacement), and below-the-knee amputation. Logistic and proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the impact of ankle arthrodesis or total ankle replacement on the rates of adverse outcomes, with adjustment for patient factors such as age, sex, race, type of health insurance, and comorbidities. We also compared patients in the 2005 to 2010 cohort with those in the earlier cohort.
In all, 8,491 ankle arthrodesis and 1,280 total ankle replacement cases were identified. Patients managed with ankle replacement were more likely to be female, white, and older and to have Medicare or private health insurance. Short-term complication risk was low for both procedures, and patients managed with total ankle replacement had significantly lower rates of readmission (p < 0.0001) and periprosthetic joint infection/wound infection (p = 0.02) compared with patients managed with ankle arthrodesis.
The inclusion of new data on patients who underwent surgery between 2005 and 2010 demonstrates increasing utilization and lower complication rates for total ankle replacement compared with ankle arthrodesis. These findings suggest that there have been improvements in the clinical safety of total ankle replacement over time.

490|27601503|Total ankle replacement versus arthrodesis (TARVA): protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial.|['ankle arthrodesis', 'ankle replacement', 'randomised controlled trial']|BMJ open|"Total ankle replacement (TAR) or ankle arthrodesis (fusion) is the main surgical treatments for end-stage ankle osteoarthritis (OA). The popularity of ankle replacement is increasing while ankle fusion rates remain static. Both treatments have efficacy but to date all studies comparing the 2 have been observational without randomisation, and there are no published guidelines as to the most appropriate management. The TAR versus arthrodesis (TARVA) trial aims to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of TAR against ankle arthrodesis in the treatment of end-stage ankle OA in patients aged 50-85 years.
TARVA is a multicentre randomised controlled trial that will randomise 328 patients aged 50-85 years with end-stage ankle arthritis. The 2 arms of the study will be TAR or ankle arthrodesis with 164 patients in each group. Up to 16 UK centres will participate. Patients will have clinical assessments and complete questionnaires before their operation and at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks after surgery. The primary clinical outcome of the study is a validated patient-reported outcome measure, the Manchester Oxford foot questionnaire, captured preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes include quality-of-life scores, complications, revision, reoperation and a health economic analysis.
The protocol has been approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee (London, Bloomsbury 14/LO/0807). This manuscript is based on V.5.0 of the protocol. The trial findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

The etiology of impingement is unclear and likely multifactorial. Because of the lack of conservative treatment options for symptomatic impingement after TAR, surgery is often necessary.
We retrospectively identified a consecutive series of 1001 primary TARs performed between January 1998 and December 2014. We identified patients who required a secondary surgery to treat soft-tissue and bony impingement by either an open or arthroscopic procedure. Functional and clinical outcomes, including secondary procedures, infections, complications, and failure rates, were recorded.
In all, 75 patients (7.5%) required either open (n = 49) or arthroscopic debridement for impingement after TAR; 44 patients had >12 months of follow-up, with a follow-up of 26.5 months after their debridement procedure. The mean time to the debridement procedure for all prostheses was 29.3 months, with an average of 38.7 months in STAR, 21.8 months in INBONE, and 10.5 months in Salto Talaris patients. Of the patients with more than 1 year's follow-up from their debridement, 84.1% were asymptomatic; 9 patients (20.4%) had repeat operations after their debridement procedure. Of these, 5 patients required a repeat debridement of their medial or lateral gutters for a failure rate of 11.4%.
Both arthroscopic and open treatment of impingement after total ankle arthroplasty are safe and effective in improving function and pain. Although the rates for revision impingement surgery are higher in arthroscopic compared with open procedures, they are not significantly so. Therefore, we recommend arthroscopic surgery whenever possible because of earlier time to weight bearing and mobility.

This treatment was abandoned due to the early failure prosthesis in the past. However, with recently advancements in ankle prosthesis design and improved surgical techniques, TAR has made great progress and the indications are expanding. Many studies have shown acceptable mid term and long term results of TAR, and it is worth looking forward to the prospect. Advantages of TAR over arthrodesis include improvement in joint range of motion, better gait activity, and decreased incidence of adjacent joint arthritis. With the further development, TAR will be considered as gold standard for the treatment of end stage ankle arthritis instead of the ankle arthrodesis. However, there are still many problems of TAR need to be solved in this present stage of development, including higher economic costs, lower survival rate, and higher revision rate. Patients and surgeons should have confidence in TAR, also need to choose this treatment with careful consideration.||||Copyright© 2016 by the China Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology Press.|10.3969/j.issn.1003-0034.2016.08.021|2016-08-25|[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Ya-Xing', 'initials': 'YX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, China; caesarzh@163.com.'}]

However, complication and failure rates remain high. Long-term results of the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) are limited, with variable complication and failure rates observed. This prospective study presents the long-term survivorship and postoperative complications of the STAR prosthesis.
Between May 1999 and June 2008, 134 primary total ankle arthroplasties were performed using the STAR prosthesis in 124 patients. The survivorship, postoperative complications, and reoperations were recorded, with a minimum follow-up period of 7.5 years. Clinical results were assessed using the Foot Function Index and the Kofoed score. The presence of component migration, cysts, and radiolucency surrounding the prosthesis components, heterotopic ossification, and progression of osteoarthritis in adjacent joints were determined.
The cumulative survival was 78% after the 10-year follow-up period. An ankle arthrodesis was performed in 20 ankles (14.9%) that failed. Fourteen polyethylene insert fractures occurred (10.4%). Other complications occurred in 29 ankles (21.6%), requiring secondary procedures in 21 ankles (15.7%). Nevertheless, the postoperative clinical results improved significantly. Osteolytic cysts were observed in 61 ankles (59.8%) and the surface area of these cysts increased during follow-up, without any association with the prosthesis alignment or clinical outcome. Heterotopic ossification at the medial malleolus was present in 58 cases (56.8%) and at the posterior tibia in 73 cases (71.6%), with no effect on clinical outcome. Osteoarthritis of the subtalar and talonavicular joint developed in 9 (8.8%) and 11 cases (10.8%), respectively.
The long-term clinical outcomes for the STAR were found to be satisfactory. Although these results are consistent with previous studies, the survival and complication rates are disappointing compared to knee and hip arthroplasty.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) are designed to measure levels of function or symptoms, largely missing whether patients are coping with ongoing limitations. This study aimed to broaden the conventional definition of a ""satisfactory"" outcome following ankle reconstruction by comparing patient-reported outcomes of patients with and without residual symptoms and limitations.
The study consisted of a cross-sectional survey of ankle arthroplasty (n = 85) and arthrodesis (n = 15) patients. Outcome measures included the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale, Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment, Short Form-12, and EuroQol-5 Dimension. Patients also completed measures of pain (0-10), stiffness (0-10), satisfaction (0-3), and ability to complete activities of daily living (ADL) (0-6). Based on a self-reported question regarding recovery and coping, patients were categorized as ""Recovered-Resolved"" (better with no symptoms or residual effects), ""Recovered, not Resolved"" (RNR, better with residual effects), or ""Not Recovered"" (not better). Recovery groups were compared across measures.
Only 15% of patients were categorized Recovered-Resolved. Most were RNR (69%), leaving 14% Not Resolved. Recovered-Resolved experienced lower rates of pain (1.4 ± 2.3), stiffness (1.1 ± 2.6), and difficulty performing ADLs (0.9 ± 1.2). Overall, outcome measure scores were high (ie, better health) for Recovered-Resolved patients, midrange for RNR patients, and low for Not Recovered patients, thus confirming predefined hypotheses. Recovered-Resolved and RNR patients had similarly high satisfaction summary scores (3.0 ± 0.0 vs 2.6 ± 0.6).
Most patients reported positive outcomes, but few (15%) experienced resolution of all symptoms and limitations. Current PROs focus on achieving low levels of symptoms and limitations, but miss an important achievement when patients are brought to a level of residual deficits with which they can cope. Patients' perceptions of satisfactory outcomes were not predicated on the resolution of all limitations; thus, the conventional definition of ""satisfactory"" outcomes should be expanded accordingly.

We describe the reasons why the decision was made to perform total ankle arthroplasty while concomitantly fusing the talonavicular joint, and discuss the rationale of the various surgical treatment options considered. We describe the clinical and radiographic outcomes achieved in this case. At 12 months post-operatively the patient reported significant reduction of pain, increased FAOS scores and had increased ankle range of motion. ||||Copyright © 2016 European Foot and Ankle Society.

The lateral talar station (LTS) classifies the sagittal position of the talus relative to the tibia. We hypothesized that correcting the sagittal distal tibial articular angle (sDTAA) during TAR would anatomically realign the tibiotalar joint and potentially reduce the risk of prosthesis subluxation.
The LTS (millimeters) and sDTAA (degrees) were measured twice by 2 blinded observers using weight-bearing lateral ankle radiographs obtained before (n = 96) and after (n = 94) TAR, with excellent interobserver and intraobserver reliability (correlation coefficient >0.9).
Preoperative LTS was as follows: anterior (60.4%), posterior (27.1%), and neutral (12.5%). A strong preoperative correlation was found between LTS and sDTAA (r = 0.81; P < .0001). In ankles that were initially anterior and became less anterior postoperatively (n = 41), LTS decreased from an average 8.1 mm to 6.5 mm and the LTS changed 1.1 mm per degree of sDTAA change. In ankles that were initially posterior (n = 25), LTS increased from an average of -5.1 mm to -2.8 mm and the LTS changed 0.6 mm per degree of sDTAA change. The correlation between LTS and sDTAA was reduced postoperatively (r = 0.62; P < .0001).
Our results suggest that rather than following generic recommendations, the surgeon should customize the sagittal distal tibial cut to the individual patient based on the preoperative LTS in order to achieve neutral TAR alignment.

However, no studies have addressed the impact of preoperative radiographic tibiotalar alignment on post-TAR gait mechanics. We therefore investigated whether preoperative tibiotalar alignment (varus, valgus, or neutral) resulted in significantly different coronal plane mechanics or ground reaction forces post-TAR.
We conducted a non-randomized study of 93 consecutive end-stage ankle arthritis patients. Standard weight-bearing radiographs were obtained preoperatively to categorize patients as having neutral (±4°), varus (≥5° of varus), or valgus (≥5° of valgus) coronal plane tibiotalar alignment. All patients underwent a standard walking assessment including three-dimensional lower extremity kinetics and kinematics preoperatively, 12 and 24 months postoperatively.
A significant group by time interaction was observed for the propulsive vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), coronal plane hip range of motion (ROM) and the peak hip abduction moment. The valgus group demonstrated an increase in the peak knee adduction angle and knee adduction angle at heel strike when compared to the other groups. Coronal plane ankle ROM, knee and hip angles at heel strike, and the peak hip angle exhibited significant increases across time. Peak ankle inversion moment, peak knee abduction moment and the weight acceptance vGRF also exhibited significant increases across time. Neutral ankle alignment was achieved for all patients by 2 years following TAR.

It does not, however, provide information regarding coordination between the segments. This study aimed to determine whether or not intersegment coordination can provide valuable, otherwise missed information in relation to kinematic alterations of the ankle joint. The study consisted of 40 participants, including 12 total ankle replacement (TAR) patients, 12 ankle arthrodesis (AA) patients, and 16 controls. Gait assessment was carried out wearing 3-D inertial sensors. Intersegment coordination was determined by calculation of the continuous relative phase (CRP) between foot intersegments. CRP analysis found useful information regarding the magnitude and directionality of segment motion throughout the gait cycle, with AA patients reporting an altered coordination pattern for all three intersegments, forefoot-hindfoot, hindfoot-shank, and forefoot-shank, and TAR patients showing alterations in the hindfoot-shank intersegment. Results show that assessment of intersegment coordination can provide further information, otherwise overlooked by the general kinematic assessment, which could be used to optimize patient rehabilitation. Furthermore, the study showed that such information could be used to compare surgical outcomes. As a result, the study concludes that the inclusion of intersegment coordination assessment could be beneficial in clinical practice. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

However, ankle wound complications can occur after TAA, which sometimes requires challenging reconstruction due to anatomical complexity of the ankle. Superficial circumflex iliac artery (SCIA) perforator (SCIP) flap has been reported to be useful for various reconstructions, but no case has been reported regarding a chimeric SCIP flap for complex ankle reconstruction. We report a case of complex ankle defect successfully reconstructed with a free quadruple-component chimeric SCIP flap. A 73-year-old female patient with RA underwent TAA, and suffered from an extensive ankle soft tissue defect (13 × 5 cm) with exposure of the implanted artificial joint and the extensor tendons. A chimeric SCIP flap was raised based on the deep branch and the superficial branch of the SCIA, which included chimeric portions of the sartorius muscle, the deep fascia, the inguinal lymph node (ILN), and the skin/fat. The flap was transferred to the recipient ankle. The sartorius muscle was used to cover the artificial joint, the deep fascia to reconstruct the extensor retinaculum, the ILN to prevent postoperative lymphedema, and the adiposal tissue to put around the extensor tendons for prevention of postoperative adhesion. Postoperatively, the patient could walk by herself without persistent leg edema or bowstringing of the extensor tendons, and was satisfied with the concealable donor scar. Although further studies are required to confirm efficacy, multicomponent chimeric SCIP has a potential to be a useful option for complex defects of the ankle. ||||Copyright © 2016 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

To date, no study has elucidated the effect of cigarette smoking on complications or functional outcome scores after total ankle replacement (TAR).
We retrospectively reviewed the records of 642 patients who had TAR between June 2007 and February 2014 with a known smoking status. These patients were separated into 3 groups based on their smoking status: 34 current smokers, 249 former smokers, and 359 nonsmokers. Outcome scores and perioperative complications, which included infection, wound complications, revision surgeries, and nonrevision surgeries were compared between the groups.
When comparing perioperative complications in the active smokers to the nonsmokers, we found a statistically significant increased risk of wound breakdown (hazard ratio [HR] 3.08, P = .047). Although the active smokers had an increased rate of infection (HR 2.61, P = .392), revision surgery (HR 1.75, P = .470), and nonrevision surgery (HR 1.69, P = .172), these findings were not statistically significant. With regard to outcome scores, all groups demonstrated improvement at 1- and 2-year follow-up compared with their preoperative outcome scores. However, the active smokers had less improvement in their outcome scores than the nonsmokers at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the outcome scores when comparing the nonsmokers to the former smokers.
Active cigarette smokers undergoing TAR had a significantly higher risk of wound complications and worse outcome scores compared with nonsmokers and former smokers.

The data from 41 patients were retrospectively analyzed from a prospective database: 19 Agility(™) to Agility(™); 4 Agility(™) to Custom Agility(™); 9 Agility(™) to INBONE(®) II; 5 Agility(™) to Salto Talaris(®) XT; 2 Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement Prosthesis to Salto Talaris(®) XT; and 2 INBONE(®) I to INBONE(®) II revision total ankle replacements were performed. Two broad categories were identified: partial revision (Agility(™) to Agility(™), Agility(™) to Custom Agility(™), INBONE(®) I to INBONE(®) II) and complete conversion (Agility(™) to INBONE(®) II, Agility(™) to Salto Talaris(®) XT, Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement Prosthesis to Salto Talaris(®) XT). The mean radiation exposure per case was significant at 3.49 ± 2.21 mGy. Complete conversions, specifically Agility(™) to INBONE(®) II, exhibited the greatest radiation exposure and C-arm time. Revision implant selection and revision type (complete or partial) directly contributed to radiation exposure. Accordingly, revision systems requiring less radiation exposure are preferable. Surgeons should strive to minimize intraoperative complications and limit additional procedures to those necessary, because both lead to additional radiation exposure. ||||Copyright © 2016 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

However, patients can still experience unresolved pain even when these problems have been ruled out. We initiated a study to more clearly define the relative risk of injury to the anatomic structures in the posterior ankle during total ankle replacement using a third-generation implant system. Ten fresh-frozen adult cadaveric below-the-knee specimens were positioned in the intraoperative positioning frame of an approved total ankle replacement system and adjusted to achieve proper foot alignment using fluoroscopic imaging. The relationship between the tibial cutting guide pins and the posterior neurovascular and tendon structures was measured using digital calipers. High rates of posterior structural injury were found. Nearly all proximal-medial pins encountered a posteromedial neurovascular structure, most commonly the tibial nerve. The distal-medial pins mainly encountered posteromedial tendinous structures, in particular, the flexor digitorum longus tendon. The proximal lateral pins were highly likely to encounter the Achilles tendon and the sural nerve. Our results support our hypothesis that the tibial neurovascular structures are at the greatest risk when preparing for and completing the bony resection, particularly with the medial and proximal cuts. Posterior ankle soft tissue structure injuries can occur during implantation but currently with unknown frequency and undetermined significance. Further study of posterior structural injuries could result in a more informed approach to post-total ankle replacement complications and management. ||||Copyright © 2016 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

A retrospective review was performed on a consecutive series of 124 patients who underwent total ankle replacement between 2007 and 2013. Demographics, case-specific data, and postoperative complications over the first year were collected. A chi-square analysis was performed to compare differences in complication rates among patients with and without additional procedures requiring a separate incision. The average patient age was 67±10 years. Fourteen patients (11%) were diabetic and 2 patients (2%) were current smokers. Eighty-seven (70%) had prior trauma leading to arthritis. Ninety-seven (78%) cases used the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR), 16 (13%) Salto Talaris, and 11 (9%) In Bone implants. Ten (8%) cases were revisions. Excluding percutaneous Achilles lengthening, 35 of 124 patients (28%) had a total of 54 adjuvant procedures requiring a separate incision during TAR. These included 9 (7%) calcaneal osteotomies, 8 (6%) medial malleolar fixation, 6 (5%) subtalar fusions, 5 (4%) lateral ligament repair, 4 (3%) open Achilles lengthening, 4 (3%) removal of hardware, 2 (2%) first metatarsal osteotomy, and 8 other procedures.
Overall, 32 (26%) of the 124 patients had a complication, including 15 (12%) delayed wound healing, 6 (5%) malleolar fracture, and 11 other complications. At 1 year, 24 (27%) of 89 patients without additional incisions and 8 (23%) of 35 patients with additional incisions, excluding percutaneous Achilles lengthening, had any complication (P = .64).
This study did not demonstrate an association between additional procedures requiring a separate incision during TAR and early complications. Overall complication rates were similar to previously reported series of TAR. This study suggests that surgeons can add adjuvant procedures during TAR to improve alignment, stability, or treat adjacent segment arthritis without affecting short-term complication rates. The necessity or utility of these adjuvant procedures requires further study.

A custom stemmed agility talar component was designed to be used in these conditions.
The first 30 cases by a single surgeon were reviewed at two intervals. The study was a retrospective chart review with data including ankle diagnosis, deformity, bone loss and other factors that may have an impact on ankle arthroplasty. American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot clinical rating scale scores were recorded and this group of patients was reviewed post operatively at a mean of 19 months (6-52), and at a mean of 54 months (37-94). The design rational will be discussed, as well as a brief description of the surgical technique.
Retention of the implant was 93 percent at a mean of 19 months and 88 percent at a mean of 54 months. AOFAS scores were improved from 55 to 71 at the latest review. Complications included two slow healing lateral incisions, one deep infection, one fractured stem, and one below knee amputation secondary to acute femoral artery occlusion.

A data-linkage study of the UK National Joint Registry (NJR) data and Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database. These two databases were linked in a deterministic fashion. HES episodes 12 months following the index procedure were isolated and analysed. Logistic regression was used to model predictors of reoperation and revision for primary ankle replacement.
All patients who underwent primary and revision ankle replacements according to the NJR between February 2008 and February 2013.
The rate of 30-day readmission following primary and revision ankle replacement was 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively. In the 12 months following primary and revision ankle replacements, the revision rate (where implants needed to be removed) was 1.2% with increased odds in those orthopaedic units preforming <20 ankle replacements per year and patients with a preoperative fixed equinus deformity.

515|27196532|Ballooning osteolysis in 71 failed total ankle arthroplasties.|[]|Acta orthopaedica|Background and purpose - Aseptic loosening is a major cause of failure in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). In contrast to other total joint replacements, large periarticular cysts (ballooning osteolysis) have frequently been observed in this context. We investigated periprosthetic tissue responses in failed TAA, and performed an element analysis of retrieved tissues in failed TAA. Patients and methods - The study cohort consisted of 71 patients undergoing revision surgery for failed TAA, all with hydroxyapatite-coated implants. In addition, 5 patients undergoing primary TAA served as a control group. Radiologically, patients were classified into those with ballooning osteolysis and those without, according to defined criteria. Histomorphometric, immunohistochemical, and elemental analysis of tissues was performed. Von Kossa staining and digital microscopy was performed on all tissue samples. Results - Patients without ballooning osteolysis showed a generally higher expression of lymphocytes, and CD3+, CD11c+, CD20+, and CD68+ cells in a perivascular distribution, compared to diffuse expression. The odds of having ballooning osteolysis was 300 times higher in patients with calcium content >0.5 mg/g in periprosthetic tissue than in patients with calcium content ≤0.5 mg/g (p < 0.001). Interpretation - There have been very few studies investigating the pathomechanisms of failed TAA and the cause-effect nature of ballooning osteolysis in this context. Our data suggest that the hydroxyapatite coating of the implant may be a contributory factor. |||||10.1080/17453674.2016.1188346|2016-05-20|[{'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Gurpal', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery , Otto-von-Guericke University , Magdeburg , Germany ;\nb National University Health System University Orthopaedics, Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery Cluster , Singapore ;'}, {'lastname': 'Reichard', 'firstname': 'Theresa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery , Otto-von-Guericke University , Magdeburg , Germany ;'}, {'lastname': 'Hameister', 'firstname': 'Rita', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery , Otto-von-Guericke University , Magdeburg , Germany ;\nc Department of Anatomy, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine , National University of Singapore , Singapore ;'}, {'lastname': 'Awiszus', 'firstname': 'Friedemann', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery , Otto-von-Guericke University , Magdeburg , Germany ;'}, {'lastname': 'Schenk', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery , Otto-von-Guericke University , Magdeburg , Germany ;'}, {'lastname': 'Feuerstein', 'firstname': 'Bernd', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'd Department of Mechanical Engineering , Magdeburg-Stendal University of Applied Sciences , Magdeburg ;'}, {'lastname': 'Roessner', 'firstname': 'Albert', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'e Department of Pathology , Otto-von-Guericke University , Magdeburg , Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lohmann', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery , Otto-von-Guericke University , Magdeburg , Germany ;'}]
517|27167420|[Eleven-Year Experience with Total Ankle Arthroplasty].|[]|Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca|"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Total joint replacement is one of the options in surgical treatment of advanced ankle arthritis. It allows the ankle to remain mobile but, unfortunately, it does not provide the same longevity as total knee or hip replacements. Therefore, decisions concerning the kind of treatment are very individual and depend on the clinical status and opinion of each patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 132 total ankle replacements were carried out in the period from 2004 to 2015. The prostheses used included the Ankle Evolutive System (AES) in 52 patients, Mobility Total Ankle System (DePuy) in 24 patients and, recently, Rebalance Total Ankle Replacement implant in 53 patients. Three patients allergic to metal received the Taric prosthesis. Revision arthroplasty using the Hintegra prosthesis was carried out in four patients. The outcome of arthroplasty was evaluated on the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring scale. Indications for total ankle arthroplasty included post-traumatic arthritis in 83 patients, rheumatoid arthritis in 37 and primary arthritis in 12 patients. There were 78 women and 54 men, with an average age of 55.6 years at the time of surgery. RESULTS The average follow-up was 6.1 years (1-11 years). The average AOFAS score of the whole group increased from 33.2 before surgery to 82.5 after it. The primary indication had an important role. Arthroplasty outcomes were poorer in patients with post-traumatic arthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis or primary arthritis. In patients with post-traumatic arthritis, the average AOFAS score rose to 78.6 due to restricted motion of the ankle, and some patients continued to have pain when walking. The average AOFAS score in a total of 49 patients who had rheumatoid arthritis or primary arthritis reached a value of 86.4. Post-operative complications were recorded in ten patients (7.6%) in whom part of the wound was healing by second intention. Ossification was also a frequent complication and had to be removed in six patients (4.5%). No early infection was recorded and late infection was treated in three patients. The prosthesis had to be removed and ankle arthrodesis performed in seven patients (5.3%). All had necrosis of the talus with ankle instability. In five, the retrograde nail Medin was used and extensive defects remaining after talar necrosis were filled with massive bone grafts obtained from a bone bank. One patient required tibio-calcaneal arthrodesis with external fixator; surgery in one case involved the use of a Zimmer Trabecular Metal Ankle Fusion Spacer with retrograde nail fixation. The development of cystic radiolucencies adjacent to tibial or talar components presents another post-operative complication. It was recorded mostly in the patients after AES implantation, in whom eight of 52 (15.3%) had these findings. DISCUSSION Total ankle arthroplasty is a complicated surgical procedure potentially associated with various technical problems. The occurrence of complications is indirectly related to the experience of the orthopaedist performing surgery; literature data show that the number of complication decreases with an increased frequency of ankle replacements done. CONCLUSIONS Total ankle arthroplasty, as every orthopaedic surgery, has its advantages and disadvantages. The positive aspects are pain relief and improved mobility of the ankle allowing for physiological gait. However, it shows a lower survivorship rate that the other large joint replacements. A successful outcome depends on the correct indication. The ankle should be stable, the talus without signs of necrosis and valgus or varus deviations of the ankle should not exceed 10 to 15 degrees.

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 300 consecutive patients who underwent 321 modern, fixed-bearing TAAs at a single institution. Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS), and the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hindfoot score were collected preoperatively and at subsequent follow-up appointments. A patient satisfaction survey was also distributed to each patient postoperatively. Of the 321 TAAs, 245 (232 patients) had a minimum of 2-year follow-up and a complete data set. Furthermore, 192 patients underwent concomitant procedures. The average follow-up was 38.9 months (24-84.5). Eight patients have been lost to follow-up (7 deceased and 1 refused further follow-up).
The mean AOFAS score preoperatively was 41.1 and at latest follow-up was 84.6 (P < .01). The mean VR-12 score was 29.7 (Physical) and 54.1 (Mental) preoperatively and 42.7 (Physical) and 55.7 (Mental) at latest follow-up (P < .01 and P > .05, respectively). AOS pain and disability scores improved significantly after TAA (P < .01). The patient satisfaction survey indicated that 84% experienced very good to excellent pain relief, 78% reported improved ability to perform daily tasks, and 54% indicated improvement in their ability to perform heavy work or recreational activities. In addition, 94% would probably or definitely have the procedure on the contralateral ankle. Two patients underwent revision TAA at a minimum of 36 months; 8 patients failed the primary TAA and were converted to ankle fusions at a mean of 20.1 months (6.1-46.1).
Early results of a large series of a modern TAA system demonstrate improvement in patient satisfaction, quality of life, activity, and pain for patients with end-stage ankle arthritis. Early revision was due to infection or loosening of the tibial component.

The purpose of this study was to assess changes in ROM and functional outcomes following tibiotalar arthrodesis and TAA.
Patients who underwent isolated tibiotalar arthrodesis or TAA with greater than two-year follow-up were enrolled in the study. Overall arc of movement and talonavicular movement in the sagittal plane were assessed with weight-bearing lateral maximum dorsiflexion and plantarflexion radiographs. All patients completed Short Form-12 version 2.0 questionnaires, visual analogue scale for pain (VAS) scores, and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM).
In all, 41 patients who underwent TAA and 27 patients who underwent tibiotalar arthrodesis were enrolled in the study. The mean total arc of movement was 34.2° (17.0° to 59.1°) with an average contribution from the talonavicular joint of 10.5° (1.2° to 28.8°) in the TAA cohort. The average total arc of movement was 24.3° (6.9° to 44.3°) with a mean contribution from the talonavicular joint of 22.8° (5.6° to 41.4°) in the arthrodesis cohort. A statistically significant difference was detected for both total sagittal plane movement (p = 0.00025), and for talonavicular motion (p < 0.0001). A statistically significant lower VAS score (p = 0.0096) and higher FAAM (p = 0.01, p = 0.019, respectively) was also detected in the TAA group.
TAA preserves more anatomical movement, has better pain relief and better patient-perceived post-operative function compared with patients undergoing fusion. The relative increase of talonavicular movement in fusion patients may play a role in the outcomes compared with TAA and may predispose these patients to degenerative changes over time.

521|27135448|Epidemiology of Total Ankle Arthroplasty: Trends in New York State.|[]|Orthopedics|The rate of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is increasing in the United States as its popularity and indications expand. There currently is no national joint registry available to monitor outcomes, and few studies have addressed the challenges faced with TAA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence, complications, and survival rates associated with TAA using a large statewide administrative discharge database. Individuals who underwent primary TAA from 1997 to 2010 were identified in the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database from the New York State Department of Health. The age, sex, comorbidities, state of residence, primary diagnosis, and readmissions within 90 days were analyzed for patients with an ICD-9-CM procedure code of 81.56 (TAA). Failure of a TAA implant was defined as revision, tibiotalar arthrodesis, amputation, or implant removal. During the 14-year period, 420 patients underwent 444 TAAs (mean patient age of 61 years, 59% women, mean Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score of 0.45, and 86% New York State residents). The primary diagnosis was 37.4% osteoarthritis, 34.3% traumatic arthritis, and 15.5% rheumatoid arthritis. Surgery for failure was associated only with a younger age (56.5 vs 62 years, P=.005). The rate of subsequent failure procedures following TAAs performed in New York State was 13.8%. The incidence of TAAs is steadily increasing. The overall survival rate in New York State is better than rates reported in other national registries, but it is not yet comparable to those of hip and knee replacements.

However, reports in the literature do not focus on the imaging features of TAA. Through a literature review, we demonstrate basic design features of the current ankle arthroplasty system, and the normal and abnormal postoperative imaging features associated with such devices. Pre- and postoperative evaluations of ankle arthroplasty mainly include radiography; in addition, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide further characterization of imaging abnormalities. Familiarization with multimodal imaging features of frequent procedural complications at various postoperative intervals is important in radiological practice.|||||10.3348/kjr.2016.17.3.413|2016-05-03|[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Da-Rae', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Eulji Hospital, Eulji University, Seoul 01830, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Yun Sun', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Eulji Hospital, Eulji University, Seoul 01830, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Potter', 'firstname': 'Hollis G', 'initials': 'HG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology and Imaging, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY 10021, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Angela E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology and Imaging, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY 10021, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chun', 'firstname': 'Ka-Young', 'initials': 'KY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Eulji Hospital, Eulji University, Seoul 01830, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Yoon Young', 'initials': 'YY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Eulji Hospital, Eulji University, Seoul 01830, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jin-Su', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Eulji Hospital, Eulji University, Seoul 01830, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Young', 'firstname': 'Ki-Won', 'initials': 'KW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Eulji Hospital, Eulji University, Seoul 01830, Korea.'}]

However, there is wide variation in its measurement: from clinical evaluation, to radiographic metrics, and gait analysis. The purpose of this study was to present and validate a simple, standardized technique for measurement of functional total range of motion between the tibia and the floor using a digital goniometer.
Institutional review board approval was obtained. Forty-six ankles from 33 participants were recruited into 2 groups: Group 1 (healthy controls) comprised 20 ankles from 10 participants. None had any musculoskeletal or neurologic pathology. Group 2 (ankle osteoarthritis) comprised 25 ankles from 23 patients. Ankle pathology had been treated with ankle arthrodesis (n = 5), total ankle replacement (n = 6), and nonoperative treatment (n = 14). Measurement was performed by 2 testers according to a standardized protocol developed for the Total Ankle Replacement Versus Arthrodesis (TARVA) randomized controlled trial. Intra- and interrater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).
Group 1 (healthy controls): the median difference for all measurements within an observer was 1.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.7-2.5) degrees, and the intraclass coefficients (ICCs) for inter- and intrarater total ankle range of motion were excellent: 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-0.97, P < .001) and 0.942 (95% CI 0.859-0.977, P < .001), respectively. Group 2 (ankle osteoarthritis): the median difference for all measurements within an observer was 0.6 (IQR 0.2-1.3) degrees, and the ICCs for inter- and intrarater total ankle range of motion were excellent: 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-1.0), P < .001) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.96-1.0), P < .001), respectively.
This technique provided a reliable, standardized method for measurement of total functional range of motion between the tibia and the floor. The technique required no special equipment or training. It provided a valid functional assessment for patients with or without ankle osteoarthritis, including those who had undergone operative treatment.

524|27113607|Variable Volumes of Resected Bone Resulting From Different Total Ankle Arthroplasty Systems.|['3D modeling', 'bone resection', 'total ankle arthroplasty']|Foot & ankle international|"The increased popularity and success of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) has resulted in the development of varying TAA hardware designs, many of which include specific bone-sparing or bone-sacrificing features. The goal of this work was to determine differences in the volume of bone removed for implantation of different total ankle arthroplasty hardware systems.
Sixteen cadaveric specimens were computed tomography-scanned preoperatively and after total ankle arthroplasty using either an INBONE II, Salto Talaris, STAR, or Zimmer TMTA implant. Geometries of the talus and the distal tibia were manually segmented and converted to 3D bony surface models. The volume of bone removed for each implant was calculated as the difference in volume between the preoperative and postoperative bone models. To account for differences in specimen size, volume was expressed as a percentage of the intact bone.
There was a significant difference (P = .049) in the average percent of talar bone removed, with the STAR and INBONE II systems requiring removal of greater volumes of bone. The INBONE II system required significantly (P < .004) more tibial bone resection than the other 3 implants when evaluating a long span of the distal tibia. However, most of this increased bone resection was medullary bone. Close to the articular surface, bone volumes removed for the various tibial components were not significantly different (P = .056).
Volume and location of bone removed for different implant systems varied with implant design.
Primary bone resection associated with different implant hardware systems varied more on the talar side of the articulation, and the stemmed prosthesis did not result in dramatic increases in periarticular bone resection. Clinicians should weigh the effects of greater or lesser bone resection associated with various implant designs against other factors used for hardware selection."|Volume and location of bone removed for different implant systems varied with implant design.||There was a significant difference (P = .049) in the average percent of talar bone removed, with the STAR and INBONE II systems requiring removal of greater volumes of bone.

Current understanding of mobile-bearing motion at the tibial-polyethylene interface in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is limited to anterior-posterior (AP) motion of the polyethylene component. The purpose of our study was to define the motion of the polyethylene component in relation to the tibial component in a mobile-bearing TAA in both the sagittal and axial planes in postoperative patients.
Patients who were a minimum of 12 months postoperative from a third-generation mobile-bearing TAA were identified. AP images were saved at maximum internal and external rotation, and the lateral images were saved in maximum plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. Sagittal range of motion and AP translation of the polyethylene component were measured from the lateral images. Axial rotation was determined by measuring the relative position of the 2 wires within the polyethylene component on AP internal and external rotation imaging. This relationship was compared to a table developed from fluoroscopic images taken at standardized degrees of axial rotation of a nonimplanted polyethylene with the associated length relationship of the 2 imbedded wires. Sixteen patients were included in this investigation, 9 (56%) were male and average age was 68 (range, 49-80) years. Time from surgery averaged 25 (range, 12-38) months.
Total sagittal range of motion averaged 23±9 (range, 9-33) degrees. Axial motion for total internal and external rotation of the polyethylene component on the tibial component averaged 6±5 (range, 0-18) degrees. AP translation of the polyethylene component relative to the tibial component averaged 1±1 (range, 0-3) mm. There was no relationship between axial rotation or AP translation of the polyethylene component and ankle joint range of motion (P > .05).
To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to measure axial and sagittal motion of the polyethylene component at the tibial implant interface in patients following a mobile-bearing TAA. Based on outcome scores and range-of-motion measurements, we believe the patients in this study are a representative cross section of subjects compared to other TAA research results. The results from this investigation indicate the potential for a mobile-bearing TAA to fall within the parameters of normal polyaxial ankle motion. The multiplanar articulation in a mobile-bearing TAA may reduce excessively high peak pressures during the complex dynamic tibial and talar motion, which may have a positive influence on gait pattern, polyethylene wear, and implant longevity.

Some patients may still have pain or may present with new pain. Suggested sources of medial pain include tibialis posterior tendonitis, impingement, or medial malleolar stress fracture. Etiology and treatment remain unclear. The objective of our study was to evaluate patients with delayed-onset medial malleolar pain following TAA who underwent treatment with percutaneous medial malleolar screw placement and propose an etiology.
Patients who had undergone TAA at our institution were reviewed and those with medial malleolar pain were identified. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed pre- and postoperatively. Radiographs were compared with those from a cohort of controls without a history of medial pain. All affected patients failed conservative therapy and were treated with percutaneous placement of medial malleolar screws positioned from the malleolar tip and extending proximally beyond the tibial component. Postoperatively, patients were placed in an ace wrap and allowed to be weightbearing to tolerance, except for 1 patient initially restricted to partial weightbearing. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded. Seventy-four (74) patients underwent TAA by the corresponding author. All (100%) were female with an average age of 66 (range, 57-73) years. Average follow-up since screw placement was 21.4 (range, 10-41) months.
Six (8.1%) underwent placement of 2 percutaneous medial malleolar screws. Patients presented with pain an average of 12 (range, 4-24) months postoperatively and underwent screw placement an average of 2.8 (range, 1-6) months after presentation. At the time of TAA, none had a coronal plane deformity and none underwent a deltoid ligament release as part of balancing. All (100%) patients had pain and swelling directly over the medial malleolus prior to screw placement. Postoperatively, 1 (17%) had mild pain clinically at this site and 2 (33%) had occasional pain medially with activity. Average VAS scores improved from 5.7 (range, 4-6) preoperatively to 1.3 (range, 0-3) postoperatively (P < .05). Three (50%) patients had a bone density test and all were normal. Prior to screw placement, radiographs demonstrated no signs of stress fracture or misalignment. Average minimum width of the medial malleolus at the level of the tibial component was 10.2 mm (range, 9.2-11.0), which was significantly less (P < .05) than the control group of 19 patients whose distance measured 12.2 mm (range, 8.5-14.8).
Patients who present with new-onset medial malleolar pain with normal radiographs following TAA may have medial malleolar insufficiency fracture. These patients can be treated successfully with minimal morbidity by placement of percutaneous medial malleolar screws. Etiology may be related to deltoid traction, subacute stress fracture, and/or impingement of the talus component on the medial malleolus. Medial malleolar pain may be misdiagnosed as tibialis posterior tendonitis, impingement, or implant failure. This diagnosis should be considered in patients who have pain at the medial malleolus, particularly if they are female or have medial malleolus thickness less than 11 mm at the level of the tibial implant. Placement of prophylactic medial malleolar screws may be considered at the time of TAA when these conditions exist.

Heterotopic ossification (HO) after TAA has been reported in the posterior compartment of the ankle. We report on a series of HOs that developed in the anterior compartment of the ankle at the talar neck region after TAA.
TAA was performed using the Hintegra and the Mobility in 54 ankles (Hintegra, 21 ankles; Mobility, 33 ankles) from 2004 to 2012. The outcome was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, patient satisfaction, and radiographic evaluation. The HO was confirmed on the lateral ankle view. HO in the anterior compartment of the ankle was classified based on a modification of the Brooker classification.
After TAA, 13 HOs developed in 12 of the 54 ankles. Six HOs developed in the anterior compartment, and 7 HOs developed in the posterior compartment. The majority of the anterior compartment HO (5/6) was observed in the Mobility group. There was no significant relationship between HO and the clinical outcomes (VAS score, P = .62; AOFAS score, P = .31; ankle range of motion, P = .31).
Besides the posterior ankle, the anterior compartment of the ankle in the talar neck region was demonstrated to be another potential area for HO after TAA. The development of anterior HO was strongly related to the wide exposure of the cancellous bony surface at the talar neck and therefore occurred more often with the Mobility than with the Hintegra prosthesis.

Revision arthrodesis presents greater short-term morbidity and long-term sequelae. 1-6 Recent reports have demonstrated the feasibility of converting a symptomatic nonunion of an ankle arthrodesis to a total ankle arthroplasty.7-9 The objective of the present study was to evaluate the short-term outcome associated with take down of symptomatic nonunions of ankle arthrodeses and conversion to a fixed bearing, intramedullary total ankle arthroplasty. Methods Five patients with symptomatic, aseptic tibiotalar arthrodesis nonunions (average age, 62.2 years), who underwent conversion to a total ankle arthroplasty were retrospectively identified and assessed at a prospective office visit. Minimum follow-up was 12 months (average, 21.3 months). Clinical outcomes were assessed on the basis of the American Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score10 and the Foot Function Index.11,12 Radiographic analysis, patient satisfaction and pain levels were also evaluated. Results The average post-operative AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score was 82.6, while the FFI was 28.2%. The average clinical range of motion was 35 degrees. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores averaged 31.1 out of 100. Four out of the five patients were very satisfied or satisfied. Radiographically, the tibial and talar components were stable in all patients without evidence of loosening, migration, or subsidence. There were no complications requiring additional procedures. Conclusions Patients undergoing ankle arthrodesis that is complicated by an aseptic nonunion pose a difficult clinical problem. Conversion to a total ankle arthroplasty with a fixed bearing, intramedullary implant is a viable treatment option with reliable short-term results.

531|27030231|Secondary Arthrodesis After Total Ankle Arthroplasty.|['hindfoot arthritis', 'subtalar arthrodesis', 'total ankle arthroplasty']|Foot & ankle international|"While it is thought that stresses through the subtalar and talonavicular joints will be decreased after total ankle replacement (TAR) relative to ankle fusion, progressive arthritis or deformity of these joints may require a fusion after a successful TAR. However, after ankle replacement, it is unknown how hindfoot biomechanics and blood supply may be affected. Consequently, subsequent hindfoot joint fusion may be adversely affected.
We retrospectively identified a consecutive series of 1001 primary TARs performed between January 1998 and December 2014. We identified patients who underwent a secondary triple, subtalar or talonavicular arthrodesis to treat progressive arthritis or pes planus deformity. Clinical outcomes including pain and functional outcome scores, revision procedures, delayed union, nonunion, complications, and failure rates were recorded. Twenty-six patients (2.6%) required a subtalar (18), talonavicular (3), talonavicular and subtalar (3), or triple arthrodesis (2). Of these patients, 14 (54%) were males with an average age of 63.2 years and a mean 70.9 months follow-up. We then compared these patients to 13 patients who had a subtalar fusion after an ankle arthrodesis.
The most common type of fixation used was 2 variable-pitch screws across each joint. Fresh-frozen allograft cancellous chips were the most common supplement to the fusion construct (80.8%). The mean time between TAR and secondary fusion procedure was 37.5 months. Overall, 92.3% of the patients went on to fusion. Two patients (7.7%) had a delayed union and 2 patients had a nonunion (7.7%) and were considered operative failures. There were 3 repeat procedures related to the arthrodesis procedure: 1 conversion of a subtalar to a triple arthrodesis, 1 revision talonavicular fusion, and 1 revision subtalar fusion. The average time to weight bearing after arthrodesis was 8.7 weeks; the mean time to radiographic and clinical fusion was 26.5 weeks. There were no secondary complications associated with the arthrodesis. Pain and functional outcome scores improved significantly. There were no differences in the rates of subsequent fusions among implant choices, though the time to fusion in the mobile-bearing prosthesis was significantly longer than the 2 fixed-bearing prostheses. Compared with the data of 13 patients with prior ipsilateral ankle arthrodeses and subtalar fusions, patients who had an ankle replacement had a higher fusion rate (P = .03) and had a similar time to fusion.
Hindfoot arthrodesis following a TAR was safe and effective in improving function and pain. Additionally, a hindfoot arthrodesis following a TAR had a higher fusion rate than a subtalar fusion following an ankle arthrodesis. Although the time to healing was relatively long, various hindfoot fusions were used to treat progressive arthritis and deformity with high fusion rates.

TTC fusion is considered by many as a salvage operation resulting in a stiff ankle and hindfoot, considerably limiting global foot function. With the evolution of prosthetic design and operative techniques, total ankle replacement (TAR) has become a reasonable alternative to arthrodesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the fusion rate of the subtalar joint in patients simultaneously treated with total ankle replacement (TAR) and subtalar joint fusion.
This study included 25 patients who underwent primary TAR and simultaneous subtalar fusion between May 2011 and November 2014. Sixteen males (64%) and 9 females (36%) were enrolled with a mean age of 58 years (25-82). Patients were clinically assessed preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Total follow-up time was 24.2 ± 11.6 months. Radiographic examination included a postoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan obtained 12 months after surgery. Three surgeons independently reviewed the CT scans and interobserver reliability was calculated. Functional scores were also assessed.
At 12 months postoperatively, the subtalar fusion rate in patients treated with TAR and simultaneous subtalar fusion was 92%. There was a statistically significant increase in American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle/hindfoot score from 27.9 to 75.1. Ankle range of motion significantly increased from 12 to 32.8 degrees. Additionally, there was a statistically significant decrease in visual analog scale pain score from 8.6 to 2.1.
TAR and simultaneous subtalar joint fusion were reliable procedures for the treatment of ankle and subtalar joint arthritis. Furthermore, CT scans showed an excellent reliability among orthopedic surgeons in determining the degree of successful fusion of subtalar arthrodesis.

TAA patients from 2005 to 2009 were identified from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases for 5 states (California, Florida, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Utah) and the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were extracted, and a multivariable logistic regression model was developed to assess risk factors for 90-day all-cause readmission and failure. Failure was defined as revision, arthrodesis, amputation, or implant removal. During the period of interest, 1545 patients received 1593 TAA. The coded etiology of arthritis was primary osteoarthritis (n = 854, 55.2%), posttraumatic arthritis (n = 466, 30.2%), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 129, 8.4%), and other (n = 96, 6.2%). The 5-year survival rate was 90.1%. Patients with a coded diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-4.01) or who were readmitted within 90 days of TAA (OR = 3.41; 95% CI = 1.67-6.97) had significantly increased risk of failure. Risk factors for readmission were Charlson-Deyo Score ≥2 (OR = 3.05; 95% CI = 1.51-6.15) and increased length of stay during the arthroplasty (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.16-1.47).

534|26965495|Radiographic Severity of Arthritis Affects Functional Outcome in Total Ankle Replacement (TAR).|['ankle arthroplasty', 'arthritis', 'outcome', 'radiographic severity']|Foot & ankle international|"It has been previously demonstrated that radiographic severity of arthritis predicts outcome following knee replacement. In certain circumstances, patients may undergo arthroplasty without severe radiographic disease. An example may be the patient with significant chondral damage unsuccessfully treated with arthroscopy. This patient may proceed to joint replacement when their radiographs would not normally merit such intervention. We investigated whether these findings were also applicable to total ankle replacements (TARs).
We retrospectively reviewed a single-surgeon, single-implant series of 178 TARs in 170 patients. Of them, 124 patients who took part in the hospital joint registry with a minimum 2-year follow-up were included for this study. The radiographic severity of arthritis was graded using the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. Preoperative weight-bearing radiographs were reviewed for severity of arthritis by 2 blinded observers: the first author and an independent colleague from the radiology department. Patients were grouped into 4 subgroups based on degree of severity of radiographic grading for arthritis-A, B, C, and D (for grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 grades, respectively). Data collected included Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS; pain, function, and stiffness), MOS 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, and patient satisfaction scores collected prospectively and at 1 and 2 years postoperation.
Groups were similar in terms of demographic data (P > .1) and preoperative FAOS scores (P > .89) for pain, function and stiffness. Group D had the biggest improvement in all domains of FAOS. This reached significance in each domain when compared to group C. No significant differences were demonstrated in SF-36 scores. Overall, 91.1% of patients in group D were satisfied at 2 years, compared with 50.0% of patients in groups A, B, and C (P < .001). In addition, 93.9% of patients in group D felt that their quality of life had been improved by the surgery, compared to 47% of patients with groups A, B, and C (P < .001). Further, 77.3% of patients from group D said they would have the operation again, vs only 52.2% of patients with grade III or less (P = .014). Patients who were ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" postoperatively had an average Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of 3.9 preoperatively. In contrast the ""very dissatisfied"" and ""somewhat dissatisfied"" patients had an average KL grade of 2.9 (P < .05).
Although this study does not explain all of the dissatisfaction in TAR, radiologic severity is an important factor that surgeons must consider when planning how best to treat their patients. There may be a different pathophysiology in this patient group that is not well served by arthroplasty.

When recognized, prompt revision could be needed to preserve the function of the implant; however, this is not always the case. In situations in which the implant cannot be revised, tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis might be necessary to salvage the extremity. The purpose of the present report is to describe the use of a custom titanium alloy truss to fill a bony void created by explantation of the implant components. Total ankle replacement was performed as the initial surgery to address end-stage osteoarthritis. Two years after the index procedure, the patient underwent revision of the polyethylene and talar components with subtalar arthrodesis secondary to progressive subtalar osteoarthritis and talar subsidence. The implant subsequently became infected and was removed. The patient underwent re-implantation after the infection had resolved, but significant talar subsidence required conversion to a tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis with a custom titanium alloy truss and retrograde intramedullary nail. At the most recent follow-up appointment, the patient was weightbearing on a stable extremity and pain free. Radiographic examination confirmed appropriate implant alignment and evidence of bone formation throughout the titanium truss. Although our results are restricted to a single case with initial, limited follow-up data, combining sound structural mechanics with an open architecture and unique texture, the custom titanium truss appears to maintain the limb length and promote healing across a large void. ||||Copyright © 2016 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The aim of the present anatomic study was to determine the relationship of the superficial peroneal nerve to the standard anterior approach for total ankle arthroplasty. The superficial peroneal nerve was dissected in 10 below-the-knee cadaver specimens. The medial and intermediate dorsal cutaneous branches were identified. A needle was placed at the ankle joint. The following measurements were recorded: bifurcation into the medial and intermediate dorsal cutaneous branches, reference needle to the branches of the medial and intermediate superficial peroneal nerve, and the crossing branches of the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve. Two specimens (20%) had a medial dorsal cutaneous branch cross from medially to laterally. Eight specimens (80%) had a crossing branch of the medial dorsal cutaneous branch within 5 cm of the incision. No intermediate dorsal cutaneous branches were within the incision. The results from the present cadaver study suggest that during an anterior ankle approach, aberrant branches of the superficial peroneal nerve could require transection in 20% of patients at the joint level and ≤80% of patients with distal extension >35 mm from the ankle joint. The risk of injury to branches of the superficial peroneal nerve is substantial. The risk of nerve injury can be decreased with meticulous operative technique, smaller incisions, and the avoidance of aggressive retraction. ||||Copyright © 2016 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The aim of this study was to objectify these morphologic changes. We hypothesized that a flattening of the talus and a broadening of the distal tibia surface occurs in end-stage OA of the ankle joint.
Twenty-seven computed tomography (CT) ankle joint examinations of unilateral ankle OA were matched by sex and age with 27 CT examinations of healthy ankle joints. Three-dimensional reformatting and measurements were performed with geometry analysis software. The following parameters were assessed: sagittal radius of the talus, talus height, and mediolateral and anteroposterior width of the distal tibial joint surface.
Medial, midsagittal, and lateral sagittal arc radii of osteoarthritic tali were significantly larger compared to tali of controls. There was a statistically significant difference in the height of the osteoarthritic talar dome in the medial and in the lateral frontal segment and in the medial central segment compared to tali of controls. The anteroposterior width and the sagittal curvature of the distal tibia was significantly larger in OA ankles than in the control group.

However, a high revision rate is associated with the Ankle Evolutive System (AES) implant, due to periprosthetic osteolysis that generates significant cortical lesions and bone cysts in the periprosthetic region. Radioclinical and histological analyses of peri-implant tissues show the presence of numerous foreign particles that may come from the implant. It is known that a precocious wear of materials may lead to an important rate of foreign body in tissues and may generate osteolysis lesions and inflammatory reactions. Thus the objectives of this retrospective study of 10 AES TAR implants (recovered after revision surgeries) are to understand how the prostheses wear out, which part is the most stressed and to determine the nature and size of foreign body particles. A better understanding of friction mechanisms between the three parts of the implant and of the nature and morphology of foreign particles generated was needed to explain the in vivo behavior of the implant. This was achieved using microstuctural and tomographic analysis of both implants parts and periprosthetic tissues.||||Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The relative midfoot index decreased in all groups from barefoot to running shoes and again to rocker bottom shoes (p<0.001). The forefoot maximal force increased wearing shoes (p<0.001), but there was no difference between running and rocker bottom shoes. Walking speed increased by 0.06 m/s with footwear (p<0.001). Total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis were equal in running shoes but both deviated from healthy controls (total ankle replacement/ankle arthrodesis smaller RMI p=0.07/0.017; increased forefoot maximal force p=0.757/0.862; slower walking speed p<0.001). In rocker bottom shoes, this ranking remained the same except the relative midfoot index merged to similar values. Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis were inferior in both shoes.
Runners are beneficial and the benefit is greater for fusions and replacements. Rocker bottom shoes have little added benefit. Total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis were equal but inferior to healthy controls. Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis has an inferior outcome."||||Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in-patient demographics, complications, and readmission rates of patients after TAA at academic medical centers in the United States. The University HealthSystems Consortium administrative database was searched for patients who underwent TAA in 2007 to 2011. A descriptive analysis of demographics was performed, followed by a similar analysis of clinical benchmarks, including hospital length of stay, hospital direct cost, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day readmission rates. The study included 2340 adult patients with a mean age of 62 years (47% men and 53% women) who underwent TAA. The majority of patients were Caucasian (2073; 88.5%). Average hospital length of stay was 2.2±1.26 days. Average total direct cost for the hospital was $16,212±7000 per case, with 49.7% of patients having private insurance. In-hospital mortality was less than 1%, and overall complications were 1.4%. Complications after discharge included deep venous thrombosis (2.3%), reoperation (0.7%), and infection (3.2%). A readmission rate of 2.7% within the first 30 days from the time of discharge occurred. Total ankle arthroplasty in the United States is a relatively safe procedure with low overall complication rates. Patients who are male, have a history of community-acquired pneumonia, and have a larger number of preoperative comorbidities had a significant increased risk of developing 1 complication within 30 days of surgery.||||Copyright 2016, SLACK Incorporated.|10.3928/01477447-20151228-05|2016-01-06|[{'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Hanbing', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yakavonis', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shaw', 'firstname': 'Joshua J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Abhay', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xinning', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}]
547|26686238|Soft Tissue Reconstruction After Total Ankle Arthroplasty.|['flaps', 'total ankle arthroplasty', 'wound management']|Foot & ankle international|"Wound complications following total ankle replacement (TAR) may potentially lead to devastating consequences. Soft tissue coverage of the prosthesis and tendons with a flap potentially prevent a catastrophic cascade leading to infection and implant failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the success and complications of flaps following soft tissue defects as a result of total ankle arthroplasty.
We retrospectively identified a consecutive series of 1001 primary TARs performed between January 1998 and December 2014 whose data were prospectively collected. We then identified patients who required a secondary surgery to treat soft tissue defects that were not amenable to split-thickness skin grafting. Clinical outcomes including secondary procedures, wound healing failure, complications, and implant failure rate were recorded. Nineteen patients had a total of 44 operative procedures to treat wound issues (1.9% of all prostheses). The follow-up time from the flap procedure is 24.1 months.
More than two-thirds (13/19) of patients had 1 or more previous surgeries on the ankle, for an average of 1.2 procedures. The mean time to the flap procedure was 13.1 weeks after the index TAR. The most common reason for flap coverage was a non-healing anterior wound. Thirteen of 19 patients (68.4%) underwent formal operative wound exploration and debridement prior to their definitive flap coverage. The average size of the wound was 5.4 × 3.8 cm with an average area of 24.9 cm(2). The most common type of flap performed was a sural pedicle flap followed by a propeller flap. There were 4 flap failures (21.1%), with 2 subsequent below-the-knee amputations. No TAR patients developed a deep infection following a flap unless they had a preexisting infection. In patients who had a successful flap, there were significant improvements in their American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot, visual analog scale (VAS), and Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment bother index, but not their Short Form-36 scores.
Ankle wounds that occur after TAR can result in a devastating outcome, but management with a coordinated effort with surgeons with microvascular experience can help achieve salvage of the prosthesis. A variety of flap reconstruction options are available and should be employed to improve the rate of implant survival and retention.

548|26677234|Conversion of Tibiotalar Arthrodesis to Total Ankle Arthroplasty.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Conversion of ankle arthrodesis to total ankle arthroplasty remains controversial. Although satisfactory outcomes have been published, not all foot and ankle surgeons performing total ankle arthroplasty have embraced this modality.
Twenty-three total ankle arthroplasties were performed in patients who had undergone a prior or an attempted ankle arthrodesis. The mean age at surgery was fifty-nine years (range, forty-one to eighty years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 33.1 months (minimum, twelve months). Indications for the procedure were symptomatic adjacent hindfoot arthritis (twelve patients) or symptomatic tibiotalar or subtalar nonunion (eleven) after tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis. We performed concomitant surgical procedures in eighteen ankles (78%), with the most common procedure being prophylactic malleolar fixation (70%). We prospectively evaluated clinical outcomes using the Short Form-36 (SF-36), Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and assessed initial weight-bearing radiographs and those made at the most recent follow-up evaluation.
The mean VAS pain score (and standard deviation) improved from 65.7 ± 21.8 preoperatively to 18.3 ± 17.6 at the most recent follow-up evaluation (p < 0.001), with five patients being pain-free (VAS score = 0). The mean SMFA bother and function indexes improved from 55 ± 22.9 and 46.7 ± 12.6 preoperatively to 30.6 ± 22.7 and 25.4 ± 17.4 at the most recent follow-up visit (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The mean SF-36 total score improved from 37.7 ± 19.3 to 56.4 ± 23.1 (p = 0.002). The implant survival rate was 87%. Four (20%) of the tibial components and fourteen (70%) of the talar components that were not revised exhibited initial settling and then were seen to be stabilized radiographically without further change in implant position. Three total ankle replacements (13%) showed progressive talar subsidence, prompting revision. Ten patients (43%) had minor complications not requiring repeat surgery.
Short-term follow-up after conversion of ankle arthrodesis to total ankle arthroplasty demonstrated pain relief and improved function in a majority of patients. Patients who undergo this surgery frequently require concomitant procedures; we recommend prophylactic malleolar fixation when performing conversion total ankle arthroplasty. The rate of complications, particularly talar component settling and migration, is cause for concern. We do not recommend the procedure for ankle arthrodeses that included distal fibulectomy."|||The mean VAS pain score (and standard deviation) improved from 65.7 ± 21.8 preoperatively to 18.3 ± 17.6 at the most recent follow-up evaluation (p < 0.001), with five patients being pain-free (VAS score = 0).

Currently two surgical treatments are available to treat haemophilia-related ankle joint destruction: ankle arthrodesis and total ankle replacement. The aim of the present study was to compare these two surgical procedures in haemophiliac subjects.
Kinematic and dynamic parameters were quantified using a three-dimensional gait-analysis system in two similar clinical cases. In Caucasian case 1, ankle arthrodesis was chosen because of a kinematic ankle flexion defect and lack of dynamic power regeneration. The defect in energy absorption was compensated for by the contralateral side. Total ankle replacement in Caucasian case 2 allowed sparing the ipsilateral knee (maximum 0.27 preoperatively vs. 0.71 W/kg postoperatively) and hip joints powers (maximum 0.43 preoperatively vs. 1.25 W/kg postoperatively) because of the small ankle dorsiflexion motion.

Most studies have been conducted retrospectively with small sample sizes and are conflicting in their outcomes. As such, no consensus exists regarding the utility of PRP for augmenting incisional healing. The Agility total ankle replacement (TAR) poses a significant challenge with respect to incisional healing in the immediate postoperative time frame and was used as a standardized implant in this study. We hypothesized that treating the anterior incision with PRP after Agility TAR would reduce the incidence of incision healing complications.
A retrospective review of 133 consecutive Agility TAR performed by a single surgeon at a single institution was conducted. Platelet-rich plasma was used to augment incisional closure in 78 patients undergoing TAR. Fifty-five patients had incisional closure without PRP application. Incision healing complications were stratified into patients healing without any complications (none), patients requiring prolonged local wound care (minor), and patients requiring a return to the operation theater to address an incisional complication (major).
No statistically significant difference existed between patients treated with PRP incisional augmentation and those without PRP augmentation. Eight patients (10.3%) receiving PRP underwent operative treatment of an incisional complication, whereas 3 patients (5.5%) who had a nonaugmented closure required operative treatment (P = .52). The incidence of minor complications was not statistically significant, with 25 (32.1%) patients receiving PRP and 15 (27.3) patients who had a nonaugmented closure requiring prolonged local treatment (P = .85).
Limited data exist regarding the use of PRP in the augmentation of the closure of operative incisions. We were unable to find a statistically significant reduction in incision-related complications in patients who had their incisions augmented with PRP.

In a previous study, we analyzed revision TAR and found low functional outcome and satisfaction. The aims of the current study were to analyze SA concerning failure rate and patient-related outcome measures (PROMs).
Until September 2014, a total of 1110 primary TARs were recorded in the Swedish Ankle Registry. Of the 188 failures, 118 were revised with SA (and 70 with revision TAR). Patient- and implant-specific data for SA cases were analyzed as well as arthrodesis techniques. Failure of SA was defined as repeat arthrodesis or amputation. Generic and region-specific PROMs of 68 patients alive with a solid unilateral SA performed more than 1 year before were analyzed.
The first-attempt solid arthrodesis rate of SA was 90%. Overall, 25 of 53 (47%) patients were very satisfied or satisfied.

Orthopaedic foot and ankle specialists were surveyed as to the activity and sports restrictions they place on their patients following ankle replacement. Fifty sports and activities were included and the results were used to derive a set of consensus recommendations. Of the 1063 surgeons that were sent the survey, 173 responded, yielding a response rate of 16.3%.
In general, surgeons were comfortable with aerobic or low impact sports and activities. Boot immobilized sports represented a grey area with the determination of whether or not to allow them based largely on the prior experience of the patient. High impact, cutting and jumping sports and activities were largely discouraged. Young age, high BMI and poor bone quality led surgeons to be more restrictive.

This retrospective study included 119 patients (120 ankles) who underwent three component TAA using the Hintegra prosthesis. A total of 63 ankles had anterior displacement of the talus before surgery (group A), 49 had alignment in the normal range (group B), and eight had posterior displacement of the talus (group C). Ankles in group A were further sub-divided into those in whom normal alignment was restored following TAA (41 ankles) and those with persistent displacement (22 ankles). Radiographic and clinical results were assessed. Pre-operatively, the alignment in group A was significantly more varus than that in group B, and the posterior slope of the tibial plafond was greater (p < 0.01 in both cases). The posterior slope of the tibial component was strongly associated with restoration of alignment: ankles in which the alignment was restored had significantly less posterior slope (p < 0.001). An anteriorly translated talus was restored to a normal position after TAA in most patients. We suggest that surgeons performing TAA using the Hintegra prosthesis should aim to insert the tibial component at close to 90° relative to the axis of the tibia, hence reducing posterior soft-tissue tension and allowing restoration of normal tibiotalar alignment following surgery.||||©2015 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.|10.1302/0301-620X.97B11.33636|2015-11-05|[{'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Seoul Paik Hospital, No. 85 2-Ga, Jeo-Dong, Jung-Gu, Seoul, 100-032, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yi', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ahn', 'firstname': 'T K', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': 'Bundang CHA Hospital, No. 351, Yatap-Dong, Bundang-Gu, Sungnam, Kyunggi-Do, 463-070, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'H J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Haeundae Paik Hospital, No. 875, Haeundae-Ro, Haeundae-Gu, Busan, 612-896, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'C H', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Yeung-Nam University Hospital, No. 170, Hyunchung-Ro, Nam-Gu, Daegu, 705-040, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Chun', 'firstname': 'D I', 'initials': 'DI', 'affiliation': 'Soonchunhyang University Medical Center, No. 59, Daesagwan-Ro, Yongsan-Gu, Seoul, 140-743, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'J S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Asan Medical Center, Pungnap 2(i)-dong Songpa-gu Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'W C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Seoul Paik Hospital, No. 85 2-Ga, Jeo-Dong, Jung-Gu, Seoul, 100-032, Republic of Korea.'}]

American volume|"Mental health status has been shown to influence functional outcome in a number of orthopaedic disorders. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to assess whether a diminished baseline Mental Component Summary (MCS) score on the Short Form-36 (SF-36) is predictive of less improvement in the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) score at the time of midterm follow-up after arthroplasty or arthrodesis for end-stage ankle arthritis.
Preoperative and postoperative patient scores on the SF-36 MCS and AOS questionnaires were obtained from the Canadian Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (COFAS) End-Stage Ankle Arthritis Database. The relationship between the preoperative MCS score and the change in the total AOS score at the time of final follow-up was summarized with use of a Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Subgroup analyses according to the type of treatment (ankle arthrodesis versus ankle arthroplasty) and preoperative MCS score (<50 versus ≥50) were conducted.
Of an initial 372 ankles enrolled, 337 (91%, ninety-five arthrodeses and 242 arthroplasties) were reviewed after a mean duration of follow-up of 5.2 ± 1.3 years. Analysis revealed no correlation between the preoperative MCS score and the change in the AOS score, from the preoperative baseline to either a mean 5.2 years postoperatively or two years postoperatively (r < 0.1 in both analyses). There was no difference in the change in the AOS score between patients with a preoperative MCS score of <50 and those with a preoperative MCS score of ≥50.

The goal of this systematic review was to analyze the number and frequency of different terms used to identify complications in total ankle arthroplasty. We hypothesized that this terminology would be highly variable, supporting a need for a standardized system of reporting.
Studies that met predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria were analyzed to identify terminology used to describe adverse events. All terms were then tabulated and quantified with regard to diversity and frequency of use across all included studies. Terms were also grouped into 10 categories, and the number of reported occurrences of each adverse event was calculated. A reporting tool was then developed.
Of 572 unique terms used to describe adverse outcomes in 117 studies, 55.9% (320/572) were used in only a single study. The category that was most frequently reported was revision surgery, with 86% of papers reporting on this event using 115 different terms. Other categories included ""additional non-revision surgeries"" (74% of papers, 93 terms), ""loosening/osteolysis"" (63% of papers, 86 terms), ""fractures"" (60% of papers, 53 terms), ""wound problems"" (52% of papers, 27 terms), ""infection"" (52% of papers, 27 terms), ""implant problems"" (50% of papers, 57 terms), ""soft tissue injuries"" (31% of papers, 30 terms), ""heterotopic ossification"" (22% of papers, 17 terms), and ""pain"" (18% of papers, 11 terms).
The reporting of complications and adverse outcomes for total ankle arthroplasty was highly variable. This lack of consistency impedes the accurate reporting and interpretation of data required for the development of cohesive, evidence-based treatment guidelines for end-stage ankle arthritis. Standardized reporting tools are urgently needed. This study presents a prototype worksheet for the standardized assessment and reporting of adverse events.

This study includes 66 consecutive patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty with the Hintegra prosthesis from May 2011 to April 2014. There were 28 females (42.4%) and 38 males (57.6%) with a mean age of about 57 years (25-82 years). Patients were clinically and radiologically assessed preoperatively and at 2, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.

Bone cysts may cause component migration, implant failure, and pain. Surgery is performed on cysts with the goals of reducing pain and preventing component failure.
We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 726 primary TARs performed between January 1998 and May 2013 and identified those who had a subsequent bone cyst grafting procedure. We identified cyst location and method of treatment. Clinical outcomes including secondary procedures, infection rate, complications, and failure rate were recorded. Thirty-one patients were treated with a total of 33 operative procedures for bone cysts after TAR. Of these patients, 22 (71.0%) were males with an average age of 62.2 and median follow-up 65.9 months.
Intraoperatively, 22 tibial cysts (71.0%), 20 talar cysts (64.5%), 5 fibular cysts (16.1%), and 13 multiple cysts (41.9%) were treated. Allograft was used in 25 procedures (75.8%), calcium phosphate in 4 (12.1%), cement in 3 (9.1%), and autograft in 1 (3.0%). These procedures were supplemented by calcaneus autograft, allograft mixed with mesenchymal stem cells, platelet-rich plasma, recombinant human bone morphogenic protein-2, and demineralized bone matrix. There were no infections or wound complications. Of the 27 subjects with a successful second surgery, the success rate for bone grafting of cysts was 90.9% (95% CI: 50.8, 98.7%) at 24 months and 60.6% (95% CI: 25.1%, 83.4%) at 48 months. One patient needed a repeat bone grafting. The 4 failures observed postprocedure resulted in 3 tibial and talar component revisions, and 1 tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC) fusion.
Grafting bone cysts without revision of TAR was in general an effective and safe means for treating patients with peri-prosthetic bone cysts. Treatment with grafting and supplemental materials may improve implant survivorship and might improve the structural support surrounding the implant. Further exploration of the etiology of bone cysts may aid in the prevention and treatment of cystic formation in the TAR.

The authors report a case series of 12 patients complaining of anterior or posterior impingement pain, 11 of which were in the absence of malalignment which were treated by arthroscopy.
Of the 106 TAAs performed between 2003 and 2012, a total of 12 subjects reported postoperative pain resulting from anterior or anteromedial impingement, medial and/or lateral gutter impingement, posterior impingement, and/or ankylosis. All patients were reviewed on a regular basis through chart review, clinical examination, and radiologic evaluation. The average time to final follow-up was 58.8 months. The average period from the original TAA to the arthroscopic debridement was 38.2 months.
The median AOFAS hindfoot score was significantly (P < .05) improved from 64.6 preoperatively to 73.5 postoperatively. Eight subjects reported good pain relief after the arthroscopic debridement, and partial pain relief was reported by 4 subjects. Three patients with painful ankylosis had no improvement in the total range of motion of the TAA implant after the arthroscopic debridement.
The results suggest that arthroscopic debridement in patients with residual pain due to impingement syndromes after TAA was effective in 8 of the 12 cases at 2 years' follow-up.

A chart review was performed for all patients who underwent primary total ankle arthroplasty between 2004 and 2009 with a minimum 5-year follow-up. Patients were separated into a reference group with a body mass index less than 30 kg/m2 and an obese group with an index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. Minimum 5-year follow-up outcomes were available for 49 patients in the obese group and 48 patients in the nonobese group. Mean follow-up was 8.2 ± 2.0 years (range, 5.1-11.5 years) in the reference group and 7.7 ± 2.0 years (range, 5.0-11.9 years) in the obese group (P = .26).
Based on multivariable logistic regression, obese patients had a significantly greater probability of implant failure by final follow-up (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.04-7.53]; P = .04). Cox regression analysis of 5-year implant survivorship showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 0.77-4.65]; P = .17).

Currently, the effect of obesity on third-generation total ankle replacement (TAR) is unknown.
We prospectively identified a consecutive series of 455 primary TARs operated between May 2007 and September 2013 who had a minimum follow-up of 2 years. We identified 266 patients with a body mass index (BMI) <30 (control), 116 with a BMI between 30 and 35 (Obese I), and 73 with a BMI >35 (Obese II). Clinical outcomes including wound issues, infection rate, complications, and failure rates were compared. Functional outcomes including American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot score, Short Form-36 (SF-36), Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) were compared. Average patient follow-up in the Obese I group was 44.7 ± 17.3 months, Obese II was 42.7 ± 16.4 months, and 45.2 ± 17.4 months in the control group.
Age, race, and smoking history in the obese group were not significantly higher than the control group; however, sex was significantly related to BMI. There was no difference in complication, infection, or failure rates between the groups. Preoperatively, the Obese II group had significantly lower SF-36 scores and higher SMFA function, FADI, and FAOS Symptoms scores. For each of the Obese I, Obese II, and control groups, all functional outcome scores 1 year postoperatively and at most recent follow-up were significantly improved. However, at most recent follow-up, Obese II patients had lower FAOS Pain and SF-36 scores and higher FADI and SMFA Functional scores.
Total ankle arthroplasty in obese patients was a relatively safe procedure. Although obese patients after TAR had lower functional outcome scores compared to their nonobese counterpart, they did experience significant functional and pain improvements at most recent follow-up.

The first search engine was MedLine (keywords: total ankle replacement, ankle arthrodesis). Seventy articles were found in MedLine. Of these, only 16 were selected and reviewed because they were strictly focused on the topic of this article. The second search engine was the Cochrane Library, where only nine systematic reviews were found on the role of TAR and AA in non-hemophilia patients. TAR and AA provide pain relief and patient satisfaction in hemophilia patients in the short term. The available non-hemophilia literature is insufficient to conclude which treatment is superior.

According to the JSSF ankle-hindfoot scale, the score for pain improved from a mean (and standard deviation) of 15 ± 9.4 points (range, 0 to 20 points) to 34 ± 5.6 points (range, 20 to 40 points); the score for function, from 21.2 ± 9.7 points (range, 4 to 38 points) to 45.1 ± 4.0 points (range, 37 to 50 points); the score for alignment, from 6.0 ± 2.8 points (range, 5 to 10 points) to 9.8 ± 0.9 points (range, 5 to 10 points); and the total score, from 43.1 ± 17.0 points (range, 11 to 68 points) to 89.4 ± 8.4 points (range, 76 to 100 points). According to the AOS scale, the score for ""pain at its worst"" improved from a mean of 6.1 ± 3.3 points (range, 0 to 9.9 points) to 2.0 ± 1.7 points (range, 0 to 6.3 points).

Not only do these problems delay postoperative recovery and threaten functional outcomes, they also carry an increased risk of progression to deep wound infection, which can jeopardize ultimate retention of the implant. In an effort to reduce the high frequency of wound-related complications after TAA, we have incorporated the use of continuous external tissue expansion (CETE) to augment our closures of the anterior ankle incision. CETE is an innovative technique that is currently being used to aid in the rapid closure of acute and chronic full thickness soft tissue defects, including fasciotomy wounds, high grade open fractures, and chronic foot ulcers. By exploiting the viscoelastic properties of the skin, this technique not only facilitates wound edge approximation of full thickness defects, it also helps take tension off tenuous incisions, thus allowing them to heal and reducing the chance for wound dehiscence. This is the first description of the use of an external tissue expander for the prevention of wound healing complications in the setting of TAA. Since introducing CETE to the closure of our TAA incisions, we have seen a decrease in the number of postoperative wound complications and time to wound healing. Based on our experience, we believe that the use of CETE for the prophylactic management of tenuous surgical incisions, specifically those used in the anterior approach to the ankle during TAA, is both safe and efficacious.

We prospectively assessed 50 patients (mean age 56 years), consecutively operated on by the same senior surgeon, between 2003 and 2006 and with a mean follow-up period of 4 years (range, 2-6.2). The component used was AES total ankle replacement. The etiologies for total ankle arthroplasty were: posttraumatic in 50%, osteoarthritis secondary to instability in 36%. Plain radiographs were analyzed by 4 independent observers, using a 10-zone protocol (location) and 5 size categories.
At 4-year follow-up, all patients had been CT-scan assessed with the same protocol by 2 independent observers. Plain radiographs showed dramatic progression of severe periprosthetic lyses (>10mm): from 14% to 36% of interface cysts for the tibial component respectively at 2 and 4-year follow-up and from 4% to 30% for the talar implant. The talar component was more accurately assessed by CT-scan (mean frontal and sagittal talar lesion: from 270 mm2 to 288 mm2 for CT-scan versus 133 mm2 to 174 mm2 for X-rays). For tibial cysts, axial views showed larger lesions (313 mm2 than frontal (194 mm2) or sagittal (213.5 mm2) views. At 4-year follow-up, 24% of patients had revision with curetage or arthrodesis, and at 7 years follow-up 38% were revised.
These results are similar to recent AES series, justifying withdrawal of this device. CT-scan was more accurate than X-rays for detecting and quantifying periprosthetic osteolysis.

Six consecutive patients with end-stage osteoarthritis undergoing total ankle replacement received preoperative SPECT-CT imaging using (99m)Technetium dicarboxypropane diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-DPD). Using imaging data for stratification, osteochondral tissue sections were prepared from SPECT-positive (+) and -negative (-) areas of tibial and talar resection specimens. Histomorphometric analyses of osteoblast numbers, collagen deposition, and cartilage degeneration were performed on hematoxylin and eosin, van Gieson's and Safranin-O stained tissue sections. Osteoclast activity was visualized using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining.
Increased (99m)Tc-DPD uptake was observed exclusively subjacent to the subchondral bone plate of tibial and talar joint compartments. SPECT(-) tissues displayed typical fatty marrow morphology containing mainly collagen-positive blood vessels and few marrow and bone-lining cells. SPECT(+) tissues were characterized by increased numbers of active bone-lining osteoblasts depositing collagen fibers. Collagen area fraction of subchondral bone marrow was significantly increased in SPECT(+) (0.52 ± 0.21) compared with SPECT(-) (0.29 ± 0.13) tissues (P = .30). Multinucleated TRAP(+) osteoclasts were absent from bone formation sites, but associated with vascular structures invading articular cartilage through the subchondral bone plate. Increased (99m)Tc-DPD uptake was specifically and strongly correlated with increased osteoblast numbers (P = .011), and with collagen area fraction (P = .030) but not with Mankin score (P = .202), or with osteoclast number (P = .576).
Subchondral bone tissues in SPECT(+) areas of end-stage ankle osteoarthritis were histologically characterized by increased osteoblast-mediated bone formation in the absence of functional osteoclasts, and increased cellularity and collagen deposition in marrow tissues.

This is a retrospective review of our institution's TAA registry to identify all patients who reported a prior history of ankle joint sepsis or osteomyelitis and who were subsequently treated with TAA with at least 1-year follow-up. The primary outcome measure was re-infection rate. Secondary outcome measures were patient-reported outcome scores, implant survival, and complications. Twenty-two TAAs were performed in 22 patients, consisting of 9 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 58.4 years (range = 30-80 years). Patients were followed for a mean of 29.3 months (range = 11.4-83.8 months). The length of complete symptom-free interval between the index infection to time of TAA was 8.8 years (range = 0-44 years). These patients had a mean 2.7 (range = 0-13) procedures involving the ipsilateral ankle joint prior to TAA.
No deep infection was observed in this series. Eleven patients were followed for more than 2 years, with postoperative visual analog scale scores decreasing from 53.1 (range = 12-90) to 20.6 (range = 0-89) of 100.

Patient charts and postoperative wound pictures were reviewed for 42 patients who underwent a compression wrap protocol and 50 patients who underwent circumferential casting after primary TAA from 2008 to 2013. A blinded reviewer graded each wound using a novel postoperative wound classification system, and recorded whether the wound was completely healed by or after 3 months. A second blinded review was performed to determine intraobserver reliability. Mean patient age was 55 years (range, 24-80) and all patients had at least 6-month follow-up.
There were significantly more total wound complications (P = .02) and mild wound complications (P = .02) in the casted group compared to the compression wrap group. There were no significant differences in the number of moderate and severe complications between each group. A significantly higher proportion of TAA incisions took longer than 3 months to heal in the casted group (P = .02).
Based on our clinical experience with postoperative wound care after TAA, use of a compression wrap protocol was safe and effective at reducing wound-related complications, and well tolerated by patients.

593|26227977|[Knee and ankle arthroplasty – What results can be expected?].|[]|Therapeutische Umschau. Revue therapeutique|Osteoarthrits is listed number one reason for adult disability. Therefore treatment of arthritis has maximum impact for the general practitioner. Disability of knee and ankle osteoarthritis causes inability to work and loss of independence. Patients will ask their physicians about expectations after total knee or ankle arthroplasty when other treatment has failed. The satisfaction rate after knee prosthesis is 75 – 89 % and for total ankle arthroplasty even slightly higher at 79 – 97 %. This is surprising because the survival in joint registry data after knee arthroplasty is 94 % compared to ankle arthroplasty significantly less at 69 % after 10 years, when a component revision is used as endpoint. In addition, knee component revision usually means exchanging to knee revision prosthesis while at the ankle it is usually prosthetic removal and conversion to ankle fusion. This difference of satisfaction is probably caused by the fact that knee arthroplasty is a standard operation and patients have very high expectations. Key to this is realistic patient education before surgery by general practitioners and specialists about the typical postoperative course with significant pain reduction not within days but rather in the first 2 postoperative years with moderate activity allowed. Candidates for total ankle replacement must be carefully selected because the prosthesis relies on a good bone stock, stable ligaments and proper limb alignment. Unlike for the knee, none of these can currently be corrected by the ankle prosthesis itself. Patients can expect significant pain reduction, better function and a slight improved range of motion after knee and ankle prosthesis. Sports activities are possible, but should be in a low-impact area. Heavy physical work or running and jumping activities are usually not possible and surely not recommended due to increased wear.|||||10.1024/0040-5930/a000712|2015-08-01|[{'lastname': 'Pagenstert', 'firstname': 'Geert', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': '1 Klinik für Orthopädie und Traumatologie, Universitätsspital Basel.'}, {'lastname': 'Barg', 'firstname': 'Alexej', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]

The hypothesis of the study was that this reaction is in part mediated by autoinflammatory responses mediated via damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs, danger signals) and pattern-recognizing danger signal receptors (PRRs).
Peri-implant tissue and control samples from 10 patients with AES implants were immunostained for hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), activated caspase-3, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE), and toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4. Results were evaluated on a 0 to 4 scale (from 0% to >50% stained area).
Peri-implant tissue around failed TAR implants had a relatively high mean HIF-1α score of 3 on a scale, which however was similar in control samples. HMGB1 (a DAMP) was seen to be mobilized from nuclei to cellular cytoplasm, and the active caspase-3(+) cells were increased. All PRRs were increased in revision samples.
Increased expression of HMGB1 and other danger signals together with increased PRR-dependent responsiveness could contribute to autoinflammatory peri-implantitis, multilocular cyst formation, and osteolysis in failed TAR implants.

This study is to compare the quality of life and functional outcomes in patients who have ankle arthritis and are with and without indicationsfor TAR.
An evaluation was conducted on 40 patients who had developed ankle arthritis from various causes. Forty patients were divided into two groups in accordance with their indications for TAR; the TAR-indicated group (11 patients) and the non-TAR indicated group (29 patients). Medical records of each patient were reviewed to collect pre- treatment visual analogue scale (VAS-pain) scores, visual analogue scale foot and ankle (VAS-FA) scores, health-related quality of life scores as ascertained from short-form 36 (SF-36), and baseline data.
VAS-pain, VAS-FA, and SF-36 scores were insignificantly poorer in TAR-indicated group (p>0.05). There were no significant differences in scores among the three groups of treatment as non-operative treatments, joint-preserving treatments, and joint-sacrificing treatments or between TAR-indicated group and arthrodesis group (p>0.05). There were significant correlations between VAS-pain and VAS-FA scores (Pearson's r-correlation-coefficient (r) = -0.389; p = 0.019) or between VAS-FA and SF-36 scores (r = 0.564; p<0.01).

However, little is known about the outcome of treatment and their management remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of periprosthetic fractures on the functional and radiological outcome of patients with a total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). A total of 505 TAAs (488 patients) who underwent TAA were retrospectively evaluated for periprosthetic ankle fracture: these were then classified according to a recent classification which is orientated towards treatment. The outcome was evaluated clinically using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and a visual analogue scale for pain, and radiologically. A total of 21 patients with a periprosthetic fracture of the ankle were identified. There were 13 women and eight men. The mean age of the patients was 63 years (48 to 74). Thus, the incidence of fracture was 4.17%. There were 11 intra-operative and ten post-operative fractures, of which eight were stress fractures and two were traumatic. The prosthesis was stable in all patients. Five stress fractures were treated conservatively and the remaining three were treated operatively. A total of 17 patients (81%) were examined clinically and radiologically at a mean follow-up of 53.5 months (12 to 112). The mean AOFAS score at follow-up was 79.5 (21 to 100). The mean AOFAS score in those with an intra-operative fracture was 87.6 (80 to 100) and for those with a stress fracture, which were mainly because of varus malpositioning, was 67.3 (21 to 93). Periprosthetic fractures of the ankle do not necessarily adversely affect the clinical outcome, provided that a treatment algorithm is implemented with the help of a new classification system.||||©2015 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.|10.1302/0301-620X.97B7.34871|2015-07-02|[{'lastname': 'Tsitsilonis', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Charité - University Medicine Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schaser', 'firstname': 'K D', 'initials': 'KD', 'affiliation': 'Charité - University Medicine Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wichlas', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Charité - University Medicine Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Haas', 'firstname': 'N P', 'initials': 'NP', 'affiliation': 'Charité - University Medicine Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Manegold', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Charité - University Medicine Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.'}]

American volume|"Obese patients have a slightly higher proportion of revision and infection following knee or hip replacement, but functional improvement is equivalent to that of normal-weight patients. We compared outcomes of total ankle replacement for end-stage ankle arthritis in obese and normal-weight patients.
This retrospective cohort study compared thirty-nine obese patients (those with a body mass index of ≥30 kg/m(2)) at a mean follow-up time of 3.76 years and forty-eight non-obese patients (those with a body mass index of <30 kg/m(2)) at a mean follow-up time of 3.92 years after total ankle replacement. Outcome measure scores (Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale [AOS] and Short-Form 36 [SF-36]) were collected preoperatively and at least two years postoperatively. Complication and revision data were collected by manual chart audits. Statistical analyses were performed with use of t tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Survival analysis was conducted with use of the Kaplan-Meier method.
The two cohorts had similar demographic characteristics. Ten (26%) of thirty-nine patients in the obese group were morbidly obese (having a body mass index of >40 kg/m(2)). There were thirty-nine patients in the obese group and forty-eight patients in the non-obese group. The mean body mass index (and standard deviation) was 36.28 ± 5.43 kg/m(2) for the obese group and 25.84 ± 3.00 kg/m(2) for the non-obese group. The obese group had significantly worse preoperative SF-36 Physical Component Summary scores (p = 0.01) than the non-obese group. Preoperatively to postoperatively, both obese and non-obese patients demonstrated significant improvements (p < 0.001) in AOS pain, AOS disability, and SF-36 Physical Component Summary scores, and the changes in these scores were similar for both groups. The SF-36 Mental Component Summary scores did not change significantly (p = 0.30) in either group. There was no significant difference (p = 0.48) in the proportion of complications or revisions between the groups.
Although obese patients had increased disability and worse function preoperatively, total ankle replacement significantly and similarly improved pain and disability scores in both obese and non-obese patients, with no significant difference in the proportion of complications. We therefore maintain that total ankle replacement is a reliable treatment option for patients with end-stage ankle arthritis, including those who are obese.

599|26041850|Intermediate to Long-Term Outcomes of Total Ankle Replacement with the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR).|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"The Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) prosthesis has been in clinical use since 1981, with investigational use in the U.S. since 1998. Few studies of the North American version of the STAR are available. This prospective cohort study analyzed intermediate to long-term outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty with use of the STAR prosthesis at two Canadian centers.
Consecutive patients who received the STAR prosthesis between 2001 and 2005 were enrolled at two large, urban teaching hospitals. Patients were annually evaluated clinically, and the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) and the Short Form (SF)-36 were administered.
One hundred and eleven ankles underwent arthroplasty with the STAR prosthesis. One-half of the patients were male; the mean age was 61.9 ± 11.7 years. Sixty-eight of the ankles underwent a total of 121 additional procedures during ankle arthroplasty, including gastrocnemius release, subtalar arthrodesis, triple arthrodesis, tendoachilles lengthening, and removal of hardware. The mean duration of follow-up for all living patients without revision (seventy-three ankles) was 9.0 ± 1.0 years. Thirteen (12%) of the ankles required metal component revision at a mean of 4.3 ± 3.0 years (range, 0.6 to 10.2 years). Twenty (18%) of the prostheses underwent polyethylene bearing exchange, mostly due to fracture, at a mean of 5.2 ± 2.1 years (range, 1.5 to 9.3 years). Most (97%) of the revisions and exchanges occurred in patients with a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or posttraumatic osteoarthritis (p = 0.0003). The mean change from baseline to final follow-up was -36.5 ± 23.3 points for AOS pain, -38.6 ± 26.8 points for AOS disability, and 9.6 ± 10.3 points for the SF-36 physical component summary score. The SF-36 mental component summary score was unchanged.
Intermediate patient-reported outcomes were good after ankle arthroplasty with the STAR prosthesis performed by experienced surgeons, and long-term outcomes demonstrated a 12% rate of metal component revision and 18% rate of polyethylene bearing failure. The revision rate was substantially higher among the first twenty ankles than among subsequent ankles, but the early ankles had nearly two years' longer follow-up than subsequent ankles. Additional study to elucidate possible reasons for polyethylene bearing failure is warranted.

The purpose of the present report was to compare the implant migration associated with the INBONE(®) I, a TAR system with a stemmed talar component, and the newer generation INBONE(®) II, a TAR system without a stemmed talar component (Wright Medical Technology, Inc., Arlington, TN). Because core decompression could weaken the integrity of the talus, we hypothesized that the stemmed component would result in greater implant migration. A total of 35 consecutive patients (age 58.2 ± 12.1 years; 23 men) were included. Of these 35 patients, 20 (57.1%) had been treated with the INBONE(®) I and 15 (42.9%) with the INBONE(®) II. To assess implant migration, using anteroposterior radiographs, the distance from the apex of the tibial component to the most distal aspect of the talar stem or to the mid-saddle of the nonstemmed component was measured. The measurements were recorded from the immediate postoperative radiographs and the 12-month postoperative radiographs. Implant migration was quantified as the difference between the 12-month and the immediate postoperative measurements. Despite our hypothesis, no significant difference was found in implant migration between the INBONE(®) I (0.7 ± 1.2 mm) and INBONE(®) II (0.6 ± 1.3 mm, p = .981). However, previously published data have suggested that implant migration can continue for ≥2 years after surgery. Therefore, additional investigations with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to draw definitive conclusions. ||||Copyright © 2015 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

One implant uses intramedullary guidance to enhance accuracy by accessing the tibial canal through the inferior aspect of the foot, potentially placing the subtalar joint articulation at risk. The purpose of the present cadaveric anatomic evaluation was to identify posterior subtalar articular facet joint involvement during intramedullary guidance to the tibial canal. Ten below-the-knee cadaveric specimens were used. After drilling into the tibial medullary canal with a 6-mm drill bit and using the standard targeting jig, the specimens were dissected, and the posterior facet was evaluated. We graded posterior facet involvement according to the location of the drill hole and, if within the facet, the percentage of the facet violated by the drill bit, with 100% representing the full circumference of the 6-mm drill bit. Of the 8 specimens in which the drill bit passed through the subtalar posterior articular facet, the encroachment was peripheral in all cases, with no specimen showing circumferential 6-mm drill bit articular penetration (no cases with 100%). Sinus tarsi penetration occurred in 20% of the cases. The dissections with articular involvement included 3 specimens with >50% of the drill bit penetrating and 5 with <50%. The portion of the posterior facet involved among the specimens that were violated was anterocentral in the joint. A risk of damage to the posterior facet of the subtalar joint exists with intramedullary total ankle systems. Our study has demonstrated that the drill bit will involve the anterocentral and anterolateral portions of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint, with <6 mm articular disruption in all cases. ||||Copyright © 2015 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

We hypothesized that the arched contour would more closely mimic the patient's pre-existing anatomy and increase the range of motion. Pain was evaluated as a secondary outcome. Twenty-eight patients (age 55.95 ± 15.29 years) were included. Of the 28 patients, 14 were treated with an arch cut and 14 with a flat cut. Although no significant difference was found in dorsiflexion between the 2 implant groups (p = .38), preoperative dorsiflexion, body mass index, implant type, and preoperative plantarflexion emerged as significant predictors of postoperative plantarflexion (p = .04). This finding indicates that postoperative plantarflexion was significantly greater in patients treated with an arch cut (30.43° ± 10.01°) than a flat cut (21.79° ± 15.70°, p = .02), when controlling for the other explanatory variables. A statistically significant improvement in pain was observed after total ankle replacement (p < .001). The mean change in pain was similar for the 2 implant groups when statistically controlling for the follow-up duration (p = .09). The findings from the present report suggest that plantarflexion significantly improves after total ankle replacement requiring an arched cut for implantation.

605|25995492|Minimal clinically important difference and the effect of clinical variables on the ankle osteoarthritis scale in surgically treated end-stage ankle arthritis.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"There is much debate regarding the best outcome tool for use in foot and ankle surgery, specifically in patients with ankle arthritis. The Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) is a validated, disease-specific score. The goals of this study were to investigate the clinical performance of the AOS and to determine a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for it, using a large cohort of 238 patients undergoing surgery for end-stage ankle arthritis.
Patients treated with total ankle arthroplasty or ankle arthrodesis were prospectively followed for a minimum of two years at a single site. Data on demographics, comorbidities, AOS score, Short Form-36 results, and the relationship between expectations and satisfaction were collected at baseline (preoperatively), at six and twelve months, and then yearly thereafter. A linear regression analysis examined the variables affecting the change in AOS scores between baseline and the two-year follow-up. An MCID in the AOS change score was then determined by employing an anchor question, which asked patients to rate their relief from symptoms after surgery.

The aim of our study was to further specify the influence of different projections on radiographic parameters used to assess component position after TAR.
The effect of varying degrees of internal rotation, flexion, and ab-/adduction on reference lines in anteroposterior and lateral ankle radiographs was investigated in a cadaveric TAR model. Observed variations were then compared with those found in 34 consecutive patients that received a HINTEGRA total ankle prosthesis in our department.
A change of rotation of 20° resulted in a variation of measured reference lines of more than 1.3 cm in anteroposterior radiographs and more than 1 cm in lateral radiographs in our experimental setting. Even higher intraindividual changes of up to 1.4 cm were observed in our in vivo series.
The findings suggest that rotational position of the leg highly influences measurements in ankle radiographs after TAR.

Apart from body weight, compressive forces induced by muscle action may affect joint loading. However, few studies have evaluated the influence of individual muscles on the intraarticular pressure distribution in the ankle.
The purpose of this study was to measure intraarticular pressure distribution and, in particular, (1) to quantify the effect of individual muscle action on peak-pressure magnitude; and (2) to identify the location of the center of pressure in the weightbearing native ankles and ankles that had TAA.
Peak pressure and intraarticular center of pressure were quantified during force alterations of four muscle groups (peronei, tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and triceps surae) in 10 cadaveric feet. The pressure was measured with a pressure sensitive array before and after implantation of a three-component mobile-bearing TAA prosthesis. Linear mixed-effects models were calculated and the y-intercept (b0) and the slope (b1) of the regression were used to quantify the size of the effect.
Mean maximum peak pressures of 2 MPa (± 2.6 MPa) and 6.2 MPa (± 3.6 MPa) were measured for the native and TAA joint respectively. The triceps surae greatly affect the magnitude of peak pressure in the native ankle (slope b1 = 0.174; p = 0.001) and TAA joint (slope b1 = 0.416; p = 0.001). Furthermore, the force of most muscles caused a posterior and lateral shift of the center of pressure in both conditions.
Our results suggest that muscle force production has the potential to alter the pressure distribution in the native ankles and those with and TAA.
Our study results help us to understand the effect of muscle forces on joint loading conditions which could be used in muscle training strategies and the design of better prosthetic components. Physical therapy or guided exercises may provide the potential to relieve areas in the joint that show signs of early osteoarthritis or reduce the contact stress on prosthetic components, potentially reducing the risk of TAA failure attributable to wear."|||Mean maximum peak pressures of 2 MPa (± 2.6 MPa) and 6.2 MPa (± 3.6 MPa) were measured for the native and TAA joint respectively.

608|25948694|Impact of Diabetes on Outcome of Total Ankle Replacement.|['diabetes', 'outcome studies', 'total ankle arthroplasty']|Foot & ankle international|"As the incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) grows, managing patients with diabetes and concomitant ankle arthritis poses a challenging clinical dilemma. While diabetes is known to be a risk factor for complications relating to open reduction and internal fixation of ankle fractures, it is unclear if DM is a risk factor for negative outcomes after total ankle replacement (TAR).
We retrospectively identified a consecutive series of 813 primary TARs performed between 2002 and November 2013 that had a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Within that larger group, we identified 50 patients with DM and used a control group without DM for comparison (n = 55). Clinical outcomes including wound issues, infection rates, complications, and failure rates were then compared. Functional outcomes, including American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot score, Short Form-36 (SF-36), Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment, Foot and Ankle Disability Index, and visual analog scale, were also compared. Median patient follow-up was 2.3 years in the DM group and 3.1 years in the control group (P = .239).
The body mass index, age, preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grading, and smoking history in the DM were significantly higher than in the control group. While 5 patients (10%) in the DM group had secondary operations related to the TAR, no patients had a superficial or deep infection. Eight patients (14.5%) in the control group had secondary operations, including 1 patient who needed a flap. There was no statistical differences in secondary operations (P = .562), revisions (P = .604), or failure rates (P = .345). For both the diabetes and control groups, all functional outcome scores except SF-36 General Health significantly improved at 1 year postoperatively; these improvements were maintained at most recent follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding functional outcomes except that at 1 year, the magnitude of improvement in SF-36 General Heath was significantly better in the control group.
Total ankle arthroplasty appears to be an effective and safe means for providing pain relief and improving function in patients with diabetes and ankle arthritis. While patients with DM were heavier and had worse ASA preoperative grades, they did not have a significantly different complication or infection rate.

609|25944517|[Total ankle replacement in patients with bleeding disorders].|[]|Der Orthopade|"Total ankle replacement (TAR) is a well-accepted treatment option in patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. However, published literature on patients with bleeding disorders treated with TAR is limited. Therefore, we carried out this prospective study to analyze mid-term postoperative results in patients with bleeding disorders treated by TAR.
A total of 34 patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis--14 patients with hemophilia type A and 20 patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD)--treated by TAR were included in this prospective study. The mean age of patients was 46.0 ± 9.0 years. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. The postoperative pain relief and functional results including range of motion (ROM) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score were assessed after a mean follow-up of 6.3 ± 3.4 years. Additionally, the quality of life was analyzed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The alignment of prosthesis components was assessed using weight-bearing conventional radiographs. The results were compared with those obtained in the control group, including 72 and 33 patients with post-traumatic and rheumatoid ankle osteoarthritis respectively.
One patient sustained an intraoperative medial malleolar fracture. In total, three revision surgeries were necessary in our patient cohort. There was significant pain relief from 8.2 ± 0.8 to 0.9 ± 1.0, as assessed using a visual analog scale. All categories of the SF-36 score showed significant improvement. The average ROM increased from 20.1° ± 6.9° to 27.5° ± 7.4°. The AOFAS hindfoot score increased from 34.5 ± 10.0 to 82.4 ± 10.2 of a maximum of 100 points. Radiographic assessment showed the neutral alignment of prosthesis components in all patients. The postoperative clinical and radiographic outcomes were comparable in both patients with hemophilia and those with VWD. Patients with bleeding disorders had significantly higher pain relief and significantly lower ROM than the patients in the control group with ankle osteoarthritis of post-traumatic or rheumatoid etiology.
Our prospective study revealed encouraging mid-term outcomes after TAR in patients with bleeding disorders. However, this surgery should be limited to highly experienced foot and ankle surgeons.

Potential benefits of patient-specific guides include improved implant alignment and decreased surgical time. The purpose of this retrospective case series was to evaluate the accuracy, reproducibility, and limitations of TAA tibia and talar implant placement and radiographic alignment using preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan-derived instrumentation in a clinical setting.
Between 2012 and 2014, 42 consecutive TAA cases in 42 patients using preoperative CT scan-derived patient-specific plans and guides (PROPHECY, Wright Medical Technology, Memphis TN) were reviewed from a single center of foot and ankle fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons. TAA implants used included 29 intramedullary referencing implants (INBONE II, Wright Medical Technology) and 13 low-profile tibia and talar resurfacing implants (Infinity, Wright Medical Technology). All patients had standardized preoperative CT scans before surgery that were used to create custom surgical plans and 3-dimensional solid cutting guides and models. All patients had a minimum 3-month follow-up with weightbearing postoperative radiographs. Patient demographics were recorded, and coronal and sagittal alignments were compared among weightbearing preoperative radiographs, CT scan-derived surgical plans, and weightbearing postoperative radiographs using a digital picture archiving and communication system.
Average age for all patients was 63 ± 9 years, with a body mass index of 29.8 ± 5.9. Average total surgical time for all TAAs was 100 ± 11 minutes, with Infinity TAAs taking less time than INBONE II TAAs (92 vs 104 minutes; P < .05). Average preoperative coronal alignment was 1.9 degrees varus ± 6.4 (range, 14 degrees valgus to 10 degrees varus). Postoperative weightbearing alignments for all TAA cases were within ±3° of the predicted coronal and sagittal alignments from the CT scan-derived surgical plans. There were no significant differences in pre- or postoperative weightbearing alignments between INBONE II and Infinity TAA cases. Neutral coronal and sagittal alignments were obtained for all TAA cases regardless of preoperative deformity. Patient-specific surgical plans were accurate to within 1 size for tibia and talar implants used. Surgical plans predicted the actual tibia implant size used in 100% of INBONE II cases and 92% of Infinity cases. Plans were less accurate for talar implants and predicted the actual talar implant size used in 76% of INBONE II cases and 46% of Infinity cases. In all cases of predicted tibia or talar size mismatch, surgical plans predicted 1 implant size larger than actually used.
Results from this study provide early clinical evidence that preoperative CT scan-derived patient-specific surgical plans and guides can help provide accurate and reproducible TAA radiographic alignments. Talar implant sizing was not as accurate due to individual surgeon preference regarding the extent of gutter debridement. Similar to other modern computer navigation and patient-specific instrumentation systems, final coronal and sagittal alignments were within 3 degrees of the predicted surgical plans, and sizing was accurate within 1 implant size. Future studies are warranted to investigate the clinical and functional implications of patient-specific TAA and the overall cost-effectiveness of this technique.

Due to these changes, outcomes of the newer designs are of particular interest. We have previously published self-reported patient outcomes for the STAR (Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement) prosthesis. The present study documents radiographic outcome measurements for the STAR prosthesis at intermediate to long-term follow-up.
Of 89 consecutive ankle replacements performed between July 1998 and April 2007, 79 had a minimum follow-up of 2 years and were followed prospectively. Serial radiographs were measured by 2 of the authors, including varus, valgus, alpha, beta, and gamma angles, as well as point contact ratio. Inter- and intrarater reliability was calculated and reported. A ""severe"" subgroup of patients with preoperative coronal plane deformity exceeding 10 degrees was assessed separately. Preoperative and immediate postoperative measurements were compared and maintenance of correction evaluated on subsequent radiographs. Heterotopic ossification and pericomponent lucency were documented and followed, and subsequent procedures were recorded to follow survivorship. The mean follow-up was 8.0 years.
Of the 79 ankles, 25 underwent a secondary surgery (31.6%). Coronal correction averaged 5.1 degrees (P < .001), and this was maintained to final follow-up. The severe subgroup (n = 21), with a mean preoperative coronal angulation of 16.1 degrees, was corrected to 4.6 degrees at final follow-up (P < .001). The severe subgroup had a higher secondary surgery rate at 33.3%, with metallic component revision or failure occurring in 3 cases (14.3%) compared to 8 (10.1%) in the entire cohort. The heterotopic ossification rate was 100%, slightly higher than prior reports.
STAR prosthesis survivorship was similar to that documented in prior studies of second-generation implants in European patient cohorts.

615|25901630|Total ankle arthroplasty with severe preoperative varus deformity.|[]|Orthopedics|Advancements in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) over the past several decades have led to improved patient outcomes and implant survivorship. Despite these innovations, many implant manufacturers still consider a preoperative coronal plane deformity greater than 10° a relative contraindication to TAA. Without proper intraoperative alignment, these implants may experience abnormal wear and hardware failure. Correcting these deformities, often through the use of soft tissue procedures and/or osteotomies, not only increases the difficulty of a case, but also the intraoperative time and radiation exposure. The authors report a case in which a 54-year-old man with a severe right ankle varus deformity of 29° underwent successful TAA using the INBONE II Prophecy total ankle system (Wright Medical Technology, Inc, Memphis, Tennessee) and additional soft tissue reconstruction. Intraoperatively, the patient's coronal deformity was corrected to 1.8°. At 8 months postoperatively, the patient ambulated without restriction and had substantial improvement in validated patient outcome scores, specifically the Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Foot and Ankle Module and the Short Form Health Survey-12 This unique report documents the first time that this particular implant, with an exclusive preoperative computed tomography-derived patient-specific guide, has been used effectively for a severe preoperative varus deformity greater than 20° without the need for an osteotomy. Future studies should be directed toward the prospective evaluation of different total ankle implant systems and their outcomes with severe coronal plane deformity, specifically computed tomography-derived patient-specific guided implants.||||Copyright 2015, SLACK Incorporated.|10.3928/01477447-20150402-91|2015-04-23|[{'lastname': 'Hanselman', 'firstname': 'Andrew E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Powell', 'firstname': 'Brian D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Santrock', 'firstname': 'Robert D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': None}]

Therefore, further critical analysis of the influence of implant position on clinical outcome is necessary.
We analyzed the reliability and predictive value of previously published pre- and postoperative coronal and sagittal parameters in routine ankle radiographs on the clinical outcome of 84 HINTEGRA total ankle replacements (Newdeal, Lyon, France; Integra, Plainsboro, New Jersey). Mean follow-up was 4.0 years, and 15.5% of the TARs had revision surgery.
Mean postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score was 71.3; mean postoperative verbal rating scale for pain was 3.1; and mean postoperative ankle range of motion was 26.4 degrees. Most tested radiologic parameters showed moderate or high intra- and interobserver reliability. With the numbers available, no significant difference in clinical outcome for all tested radiologic parameters could be detected.
Our results indicate that mild malalignment of TAR, as assessed on routine ankle radiographs, did not affect midterm clinical outcome after TAR. Further multicenter studies with longer follow-up are needed to support our findings.

We used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to study the time-trends. Race was categorized as White and Black. Utilization rates were calculated for the U.S. general population per 100,000. Hospital length of stay, discharge disposition and mortality after TAA were assessed. We used the Cochran Armitage trend test to assess time-trends from 1998 to 2011 and chi-square test to compare TAA utilization. We used analysis of variance or chi-squared test to compare the characteristics of Whites and Blacks undergoing TAA and logistic regression to compare mortality, length of stay and discharge to home versus medical facility.
The mean ages for Whites undergoing TAA were 62 years and for Blacks was 52 years. Significant racial disparities were noted in TAA utilization rates (/100,000) in 1998, 0.14 in Whites vs. 0.07 in Blacks (P<0.0001; 2-fold) and in 2011, 1.17 in Whites vs. 0.33 in Blacks (P<0.0001; 4-fold). Racial disparities in TAA utilization increased significantly from 1998 to 2011 (P<0.0001). There was a trend towards statistical significance for the difference in the length of hospital stay in Blacks vs. Whites (52.9% vs. 44.3% with length of hospital stay higher than the median; P=0.08).

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of age on the clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported outcomes of patients with end-stage ankle arthritis treated with TAA using modern prostheses.
Patients who underwent primary TAA from June 2007 to July 2011 were prospectively enrolled in the study. Three hundred and ninety-five consecutive patients were reviewed with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (range, 2-5.4 years). Patients were divided into 3 groups based on age at the time of surgery (<55, 55-70, and >70 years). Patient-reported outcome scores, physical performance scores, and weight-bearing radiographs were used to assess patients preoperatively and at yearly postoperative office visits. Revision was defined as failure of either the tibial or talar components requiring removal of the metallic implants. A repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc testing and the Pearson chi-square test were used to assess differences between the 3 groups. Statistical significance was set at an alpha level of .05.
Patients under the age of 55 had a greater improvement in Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Vitality (P = .026) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Function scores (P < .001) compared with patients over the age of 70 at most recent follow-up. There were no differences in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score or the physical performance outcomes between the age groups.

622|25837859|Total ankle replacement.|[]|Deutsches Arzteblatt international|"About 1% of adults suffer from painful osteoarthritis of the ankle. The current literature contains no information on the percentage of such patients who derive long-term relief of symptoms from conservative treatment. Advanced ankle osteoarthritis can be treated with non-joint-preserving measures, such as total ankle replacement and ankle fusion.
This review is based on selected relevant publications, guidelines from Germany and abroad, and the authors' personal experience.
Before surgery is considered, conservative measures such as physiotherapy and orthopedic aids should be used to the fullest possible extent. No randomized trials have yet been published comparing total ankle replacement with ankle fusion. Total ankle replacement with newer types of prosthesis yields good to very good intermediate-term and long-term results, with mean success rates of up to 90% at 10 years (range, 68-100%). Independent risk factors for the failure of ankle replacement are age over 70 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.84), primary osteoarthritis (OR 7.19), post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OR 6.2), and type of prosthesis (e.g., single hydroxyapatite coating: OR 15.04). The average range of motion of the replaced ankle joint is 25° to 30°, with values as high as 60°.
Total ankle replacement is a good treatment option for complete, end-stage ankle arthritis. It can restore joint function and make the patient mobile with little or no pain. There are, however, many contraindications to be taken into account. There is a need for further studies of the biomechanics of arthritic and replaced ankle joints and for long-term follow-up studies of total ankle replacement."|Total ankle replacement is a good treatment option for complete, end-stage ankle arthritis.

A consecutive series of first- and second-generation primary TARs with modular intramedullary stems were identified. Clinical outcome data were collected prospectively--including visual analog scale for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot-ankle, Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment, and Short Form-36 scores. Preoperative coronal plane deformity and correction of deformity after TAR were assessed. Complications, subsequent procedures, and failure rates were compared. A total of 193 first- and 56 second-generation patients were identified with a mean follow-up of 3.7 and 2.1 years, respectively.
Clinical outcome data reflected significant improvements at 1 year postoperatively, and improvements were maintained at 2-year follow-up for each group. Improvement in visual analog scale scores were significantly better in the second-generation group at 1 year postoperatively, but this was not maintained at 2 years. Mean coronal tibiotalar angles for ankles with preoperative varus or valgus deformities were significantly improved. Correction was maintained until final follow-up, with no significant differences in deformity improvement between groups.

The implant failure rate was higher in the first-generation group (6.0%) compared to the second-generation group (2.6%) at 2 years postoperatively, but the time until failure was not significantly different (P = .295).|© The Author(s) 2015.|10.1177/1071100715576568|2015-03-15|[{'lastname': 'Lewis', 'firstname': 'John S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA john.lewis@duke.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Green', 'firstname': 'Cynthia L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Duke University School of Medicine, Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Durham, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Adams', 'firstname': 'Samuel B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Easley', 'firstname': 'Mark E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'DeOrio', 'firstname': 'James K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nunley', 'firstname': 'James A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.'}]

Obesity is associated with a greater incidence of musculoskeletal disease, particularly osteoarthritis of the weight-bearing joints, including the ankle. The objective of the present study was to use a national database to examine the association between obesity and postoperative complications after TAA and AA.
The PearlDiver database was queried for patients undergoing AA and TAA using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) procedure codes. Patients were divided into obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2)) and nonobese (body mass index <30 kg/m(2)) cohorts using ICD-9 codes for body mass index and obesity. Complications within 90 days postoperatively were assessed using ICD-9 and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.
23,029 patients were identified from 2005 to 2011, including 5361 with TAA and 17,668 with AA. Obese TAA patients had a significantly increased risk of 90-day major, minor, local, systemic, venous thromboembolic, infectious, and medical complications compared with nonobese patients. The incidence of revision TAA was also significantly higher in obese patients compared with nonobese patients. Findings were similar for AA, as all types of complications were significantly higher in obese patients compared with nonobese patients.
Obesity was associated with significantly increased rates of all complications after both TAA and AA. The cause of this association was likely multifactorial, including increased rates of medical comorbidities, intraoperative factors, and larger soft tissue envelopes.

As an increasingly prevalent joint replacement operation, total ankle replacement poses a notable cost to the health care market in an era of cost containment. The purpose of this study was to compare the costs and benefits of routine histopathological examination of specimens removed during total ankle replacement. We hypothesized that a new diagnosis would rarely be found and such examination would seldom alter patient care.
A retrospective review was conducted of all total ankle replacement operations between 2006 and July 2014 at the investigators' institution. Medical records for 90 patients, undergoing a total of 95 total ankle replacement operations, were reviewed to determine the clinical and pathological diagnoses for each operation and, subsequently, the rates of discrepancy and discordance. Professional charges were determined using estimated reimbursement rates for the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes billed: 88304 (level III microscopic examination), 88305 (level IV microscopic examination), and 88311 (decalcification).
Degenerative joint disease was diagnosed by the pathologist in 93.7% of cases (89/95), pseudogout in 4.2% (4/95), and rheumatoid arthritis in 2.1% (2/95). The 4 diagnoses of pseudogout were the only cases of new diagnoses based on pathological review. A total of $16,536.81 was spent for examination of all specimens, for an estimated $4,134.20 spent per discrepant diagnosis. Patient care was unaffected by pathological examination.
A new diagnosis was rarely found by histopathological examination, and patient care remained unaltered in all cases. The costs of routine histopathological examination of tissue specimens removed during total ankle replacement, therefore, outweigh clinical benefits, and such examination should be left to the discretion of the operating surgeon.

However, a gap between established medical guidelines and the information provided on the Internet exists. Because of the general poor quality of the medical information available on the Internet and the increasing popularity of total ankle replacement (TAR) with its known potential serious complications, we undertook the present study to evaluate the information on TAR available to the general public through the Internet and to determine the quality of information according to authorship type and site certification status. Three common search engines were used to identify a total of 105 websites. The TAR information quality was rated as ""excellent,"" ""high,"" ""moderate,"" ""low,"" or ""unacceptable."" The sites were evaluated for authorship or sponsorship, content, and other criteria. The data were analyzed as a complete set, as a comparison among authorship types (academic, private, industry, or other), and by certification status. Websites with scores of excellent or high were 35% of the sites reviewed, and 48% were ranked as poor or unacceptable. Of the authorship types, the highest quality authorship was for the industry and other sites, which rated high or excellent 46% of the time. Eight percent of the sites evaluated were certified; however, certification status was not associated with improved information quality. Our study has demonstrated a low quality of TAR information available across all website types, regardless of authorship type. We suggest a partnership between professional organizations and physicians to ensure that provider websites reflect the current indications and contraindications of TAR to enhance patient education.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in decreasing the rate of wound healing problems after total ankle arthroplasty.
This is a retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty by a single surgeon at a single institution between 2009 and 2013. The incisional negative pressure dressing was applied to all patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty between 2012 and 2013 with a continuous application of -80 mm Hg negative pressure for 6 days postoperatively. The control group consisted of patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty between 2009 and 2012 with a conventional nonadherent gauze dressing. Seventy-four patients were involved in this study: 37 in the control group and 37 in the incisional NPWT group.
All patients tolerated the incisional NPWT to completion without any dressing failures or skin problems. Both groups showed similar distributions in demographics and perioperative risk factors for wound healing. There were 9 (24%) wound healing problems in the control group and 1 (3%) in the incisional NPWT group. Incisional NPWT was found to reduce wound healing problems with an odds ratio of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.01-0.50; P = .004).
Our study demonstrated that there was a decreased incidence of wound healing problems following total ankle arthroplasty with incisional NPWT dressings. This is the first study evaluating the efficacy of incisional NPWT as an adjunct treatment for wound healing after total ankle arthroplasty.

The investigation of a painful total ankle replacement (TAR) is difficult, often not delineating a definitive cause. Our aim in this study was to investigate the use of SPECT-CT imaging in painful TARs.
We performed a retrospective analysis of SPECT imaging performed for painful TARs in our department between October 2010 and December 2014. There were 14 patients identified who had undergone SPECT-CT imaging for a painful TAR. The mean age was 63.1 years, with a male/female sex ratio of 2:3 and a minimum time from surgery to imaging of 18 months.
Of the 14 patients, 13 were positive for increased osteoblastic activity in relation to the periprosthetic area consistent with implant loosening. The most common finding was tracer activity in relation to the talar component in 13 cases. There was additional tracer activity localized to the tibial component in 5 of these cases. In 10 of the 13 cases with prosthetic loosening/failure of bony ongrowth, there was no evidence of loosening on the plain radiographs. Infection was ruled out by using joint aspiration as clinically indicated.
In our series, SPECT-CT imaging revealed a high incidence of medial sided talar prosthesis activity consistent with loosening. The finding of a high incidence of talar nonintegration illustrates the limitations of conventional radiology in follow-up of total ankle replacements, as this was not apparent on plain radiographs. We therefore conclude that there should be a high index of suspicion for talar prosthesis nonintegration in patients with otherwise unexplained ongoing medial pain in total ankle replacements.

However, few studies have compared the different types of implants. The purpose of this study was to perform a retrospective evaluation of patient outcomes and complications by comparing TAA procedures performed with HINTEGRA versus MOBILITY systems.
Fifty-two consecutively enrolled patients (28 men and 24 women; mean age 64.8 years) underwent TAA using HINTEGRA (21 ankles) or MOBILITY (33 ankles) between September 2004 and July 2012. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores were determined at each follow-up visit. The radiographs were reviewed to assess component positioning, radiolucency, heterotopic ossification, and other factors. The mean follow-up period was 28.3 months in the HINTEGRA group and 32.5 months in the MOBILITY group.
VAS decreased from 8.3 to 2.0 for the HINTEGRA group and from 7.9 to 2.7 for the MOBILITY group. The AOFAS score increased from 43.8 to 87.3 for the HINTEGRA group and from 46.6 to 83.7 for the MOBILITY group. Intra- and postoperative malleolar fractures were not noted in the HINTEGRA group, whereas 5 ankles (15.2%) in the MOBILITY group sustained this injury (P = .144). Ankle impingement syndrome was noted in 8 ankles (38.1%) in the HINTEGRA group and 3 (9.1%) in the MOBILITY group (P = .015). However, no significant differences in postoperative osteolysis and neuralgia were noted between the groups.
Both implants exhibited favorable clinical outcome without significant differences. However, in terms of complications, ankle impingement syndrome was significantly more common in the HINTEGRA group, while intraoperative malleolar fracture was observed only in the MOBILITY group.

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of symptomatic VTE events after TAA without use of chemoprophylaxis and to identify risk factors contributing to the occurrence of VTEs.
We conducted a retrospective chart review of 637 patients (664 ankles) who received a TAA between May 2007 and January 2014 and had a minimum follow-up of 3 months. Chemoprophylaxis was prescribed only in the setting of a history of VTE or active coagulopathy. Patients were continued on chemoprophylactic agents if they were taking these medications preoperatively. A VTE event was defined when clinical signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were confirmed with use of Doppler ultrasonography or pulmonary embolism was confirmed with the use of a computed tomography scan. Routine screening for VTE was not performed.
The overall incidence of clinically detected VTE events was 0.60% (4/664), with 0.45% (3 patients) developing a DVT and 0.15% (1 patient) developing a nonfatal pulmonary embolism. Moreover, we identified a subset of 434 patients without identifiable preoperative risk factors who were not taking chemoprophylaxis preoperatively and were not prescribed chemoprophylaxis postoperatively. Two of these patients developed a DVT postoperatively (0.46%). Given the low incidence of clinically detected VTE, no significant correlation could be identified between the occurrence of VTE events and risk factors.
Our results suggest that clinically detectable VTE after TAA is uncommon. Patients without identifiable risk factors do not appear to require chemoprophylaxis following TAA. We recommend continuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy in patients who are taking these medications preoperatively and the initiation of chemoprophylaxis postoperatively in patients with known risk factors for VTE.

However, a frequent complication of the procedure is nerve impingement related to either to heterotrophic bone growth or the prosthesis itself. Successful resolution of this complication presents a challenge to clinicians. We present a case of lateral impingement following total ankle arthroplasty that was successfully treated using a partial transmalleolar approach to effect a partial osteotomy of the lateral malleolus and create a fragment attached to the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. This approach provides a good operative field in the lateral gutter with minimal soft tissue impairment. It also facilitates curettage, and resolution of tissue impingement. The osteotomy site healed fully by 3 months postoperative, and the pain around the lateral malleolus resolved. Furthermore, the patient's score on the Japanese Society for Surgery of the Foot Ankle/Hindfoot Scale improved from 33 preoperatively to 82 at 6 months postoperative. ||||Copyright © 2015 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

This is a retrospective review of infected total ankle arthroplasty at one institution from 1995 to 2012. Risk factors were compared between patients with infected total ankle arthroplasty and age- and sex-matched patients who did not have infection (control patients) within the same time period.
966 patients with total ankle arthroplasty were reviewed, and 29 cases of infected total ankle arthroplasty (3.2%) were identified. The incidence of infection in primary ankle arthroplasty was 2.4% and in revision arthroplasty was 4%. Risk factors for infection in our cohort included diabetes, prior ankle surgery, and wound healing problems more than 14 days postoperatively. No significant difference was found between groups with respect to risk factors including smoking, body mass index, and operative time. At latest follow-up, none of the patients had signs of persistent infection. Operative intervention of infected total ankle arthroplasty resulted in limb salvage in 79% of cases (a 21% amputation rate). At final follow-up, 65.5% of cases were infection-free with retained arthroplasty. This was achieved by irrigation and debridement alone, 1-stage fusion, and most often 2-stage revision. The final outcome was fusion in 3 of 29 cases (10.3%).
Given the morbidity of infected ankle arthroplasty, careful consideration should be made about performing arthroplasty in patients with multiple prior surgeries and comorbidities that predispose to wound-healing difficulties.

Few studies have examined orthopaedic complications and outcomes in VWD patients treated for end-stage ankle OA with total ankle replacement (TAR). To determine the clinical presentation, intraoperative and postoperative complications and evaluate the mid-term outcome in VWD patients treated with TAR. Eighteen patients with VWD with mean age 47.3 years (range = 34.0-68.7) were treated for end-stage ankle OA with TAR. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.5 years (range = 2.9-13.2). Intraoperative and perioperative complications were recorded. Component stability was assessed with weight-bearing radiographs. Clinical evaluation included range of motion (ROM) tests using a goniometer and under fluoroscopy using a lateral view. Clinical outcomes were analysed by a visual analogue scale, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) health survey. One patient sustained an intraoperative medial malleolar fracture. In two patients delayed wound healing was observed. Two secondary major surgeries were performed. Pain level decreased from 8.2 ± 0.9 (range = 7-10) preoperatively to 1.1 ± 1.2 (range = 0-4) postoperatively. Significant functional improvement including ROM was observed. All categories of SF-36 score showed significant improvement in quality of life. Mid-term results of TAR in patients with VWD are encouraging. The total rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications was 33.3%. However, longer term outcomes are necessary to fully understand the clinical benefit of TAR in patients with VWD.||||© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.|10.1111/hae.12561|2015-02-18|[{'lastname': 'Barg', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Orthopaedic Department, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiewiorski', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Orthopaedic Department, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Anderson', 'firstname': 'A E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, Harold K.

Aseptic loosening is one of the primary mechanisms of failure in TAR. Since a cross-linked ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is used as liner material, there is a need to quantify and develop methods to estimate the wear rates of the liners. High contact stresses develop during the gait generates wear debris resulting in osteolysis and early loosening of the prostheses.
In this paper wear characteristics of Wright State University (WSU) TARs were determined by applying shear and torsion loads. Viscoelastic properties were used to model the liner component. Finite element analysis was conducted to determine the wear rate by deriving Von Mises and contact stresses generated in the liner and wear rate equation was used to predict the wear rate.
Titanium alloy has shown less resistance towards shear forces when compared with other metal alloys. Under torsion, rotation angle plays a significant role in affecting the peak stress values. The maximum average contact stress was 14.46 MPa under torsion load which contributes to a wear rate of 0.67 (mm(3)/year) for one of the mobile bearing models. The maximum average contact stress and wear rate obtained from the analytical study were 10.55 MPa and 0.33 (mm(3)/year), respectively for mobile bearing models. When compared with mobile bearing model, fixed bearing model has shown higher stresses at different degrees of rotation.
Both shear and torsion loads cause significantly lower contact stresses and wear when compared to the axial load. Further studies are necessary to accurately determine the wear behavior of fixed bearing TAR models."|Both shear and torsion loads cause significantly lower contact stresses and wear when compared to the axial load.

We analyzed prosthetic survival, self-reported function, and patient satisfaction after component exchange. Patients and methods We identified patients in the Swedish Ankle Registry who underwent exchange of a tibial and/or talar component between January 1, 1993 and July 1, 2013 and estimated prosthetic survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis. We evaluated the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) SEFAS, EQ-5D, EQ-VAS, SF-36, and patient satisfaction by direct questions.
69 patients underwent revision TAR median 22 (0-110) months after the primary procedure. 24 of these failed again after median 26 (1-110) months. Survival analysis of revision TAR showed a 5-year survival rate of 76% and a 10-year survival of 55%. 29 patients with first revision TAR in situ answered the PROMs at mean 8 (1-17) years after revision and had the following mean scores: SEFAS 22, SF-36 physical 37 and mental 49, EQ-5D index 0.6, and EQ-VAS 64. 15 of the patients were satisfied, 5 were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 9 were dissatisfied.
Revision TAR had a 10-year survival of 55%, which is lower than the 10-year survival of 74% for primary TAR reported from the same registry. Only half of the patients were satisfied.

American volume|"The present study evaluated the early clinical outcomes, radiographic parameters, and survivorship of first and second-generation INBONE intramedullary-fixation total ankle arthroplasties.
Fifty-nine primary total ankle arthroplasties utilizing INBONE I or II implants were performed in fifty-nine patients (thirty-one men and twenty-eight women; mean age, 57.2 years) from 2008 to 2012. The AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society) ankle-hindfoot score and VAS (visual analog scale) pain score were recorded preoperatively and at the time of the latest follow-up. Weight-bearing radiographs were used to determine ankle motion and assess component alignment and subsidence. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, reoperations, and failures were evaluated.
All fifty-nine patients were available for follow-up at least two years after surgery; the mean follow-up duration was 35.0 ± 11.9 months. The estimated survival rate at two years was 96.6% in the entire cohort (91.3% in the INBONE I group and 100% in the INBONE II group) when revision of the tibial and/or the talar component was used as the end point. The mean AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score improved from 44.1 to 87.3 at the time of the latest follow-up (p < 0.01), and the mean VAS pain score improved from 8.1 to 1.6 (p < 0.01). Mean total ankle motion improved from 29.0° to 38.0° (p < 0.01). Fourteen patients (24%) required a reoperation because of a postoperative complication. Five of these patients (four with INBONE I implants and one with INBONE II implants; 8% of the entire cohort) required revision surgery at a mean of 32.4 months (range, fifteen to fifty-eight months) because of symptomatic talar subsidence. Talar revisions utilized an INBONE II implant with a pegged talar sulcus for definitive management. The patients who underwent revision surgery had mean total ankle motion of 41.6°, neutral alignment, and no further reoperations at the time of the latest follow-up.
Early results of INBONE intramedullary-fixation total ankle arthroplasty demonstrated improved patient-reported outcomes and increased ankle motion at a minimum follow-up of two years.

Many measures used to assess operative hindfoot interventions vary in content, and some have not been psychometrically validated in this population. The purpose of this study was to compare measurement properties of 6 lower-extremity patient-reported outcome measures, and to evaluate their reliability and validity in light of patients' preferences.
Cross-sectional survey of 42 preoperative and 100 postoperative patients completed 6 lower-extremity outcome measures on 2 occasions: Foot Function Index (FFI), Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS), patient-reported items of the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society Questionnaire (AOFAS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), as well as measures of preference, and symptoms.
Internal consistency was good to excellent for all scales and subscales (α = .84-.97; ICC [2,1] = .81-.96). Correlations between scales ranged from .50 (WOMAC(Stiffness) and FFI(Activity) Limitations) to .92 (LEFS and SMFA(Overall), WOMAC(Pain) and AOS(Overall), FFI(Overall) and AOFAS(Overall)). Higher correlations occurred within instruments (r = .97 AOS(Pain) and AOS(Overall)) and between similar subscales from different instruments (r = .91 WOMAC(Pain) and AOS(Pain)). Construct validity showed moderate to high correlations to global ratings of Pain, Stiffness, and difficulty performing Daily Activities. The highest correlations (r > .75) occurred between Pain and AOS(Overall) (r = .84), stiffness and WOMAC(Stiffness) (r = .81), and Daily Activities and AOS(Disability) (r = .87). Patients rated instruments by preference. FFI, WOMAC, LEFS, and SMFA rated favorably for length. FFI, WOMAC, LEFS, and AOFAS rated high for understandability. FFI was rated by postoperative patients as most likely to capture change due to surgery. SMFA rated the best overall.
Direct comparison of instruments revealed similarity between scales in construct validity and reliability. Patient preferences supported the use of these scales. Foot-specific instruments offered no clear advantage over lower-extremity instruments.

Outcomes based on patient expectation and satisfaction may be more useful. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate associations between patient expectation, satisfaction, and outcome scores for ankle fusion and total ankle replacement (TAR).
In total, 654 ankles in 622 patients were analyzed at a mean of 61 months. Patient expectation and satisfaction with symptoms were quantified pre- and postoperatively using the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management Scale questionnaires from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, while function was quantified using the AOS.
Patients undergoing ankle replacement had a higher preoperative expectation score (79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 77-81) compared with those undergoing ankle fusion (72; 95% CI, 68-75). Preoperative expectation scores correlated weakly with AOS scores (R (2) = 0.02) and with the ""expectations met"" score for ankle fusion (R (2) = 0.07) but not for ankle replacement (R (2) < 0.01). Satisfaction scores were similar for ankle fusion and ankle replacement at follow-up, but a greater number of ankle replacement patients showed improvement in satisfaction (84% vs 74%, P < .005). Higher satisfaction at final follow-up was associated with better expectations met and greater improvement in AOS outcome scores for both ankle fusion and ankle replacement. Expectations met and AOS scores at follow-up correlated for ankle fusion (R (2) = 0.38, P < .0001) and ankle replacement (R (2) = 0.31, P < .0001).
Patients undergoing TAR had higher expectation scores prior to surgery than those undergoing ankle fusion. Expectations may be more likely to be met by ankle replacement compared with ankle fusion. Ankle replacement patients were more likely to report improved satisfaction scores after surgery. Preoperative expectation scores showed little correlation with preoperative AOS scores, indicating that expectation is independent of pain and function. However, postoperative expectations met and satisfaction scores were strongly associated with AOS scores at follow-up. Better preoperative patient education may change expectations and requires study.

In recent years, total ankle arthroplasties are commonly placed in patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthrosis, supplanting ankle arthrodesis as the procedure of choice at some institutions. Careful clinical and preoperative radiographic evaluation is helpful to plan concomitant ligament release, ligament reconstruction, or osteotomy.

The purpose of this investigation was to perform a systematic review of clinical outcomes following a salvage ankle arthrodesis from a failed TAR to identify patient- and technique-specific prognostic factors and to determine the clinical outcomes and complications following an ankle arthrodesis for a failed TAR.
We searched PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies that analyzed ankle fusion after failed TAR with a minimum follow-up of 1 year.
We included 16 studies (193 patients). The majority of patients (41%) underwent the index TAR for rheumatoid arthritis. The majority of these revision surgeries were secondary to component loosening, frequently of the talar component (38%). In the cases that were revised to an ankle arthrodesis, 81% fused after their first arthrodesis procedure. The intercalary bone graft group and the blade plate group had the highest rate of fusion after the first attempt at fusion at 100%, whereas the tibiotalocalcaneal fusion with cage group had the lowest fusion rate at 50%. The overall complication rate was 18.2%, whereas the overall nonunion rate was 10.6%.
A salvage ankle arthrodesis for a failed TAR results in favorable clinical end points and overall satisfaction at short-term follow-up if the patients achieve fusion. The bone graft fusion and blade plate group resulted in the highest first-attempt fusion rate, with a low complication rate. Future studies should include prospective, comparative control or surgical groups and use standardized outcome measurements that will make direct comparisons easier.

Commonly, simulations are performed by applying pre-defined setpoints for the kinetics and kinematics on all degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the cadaveric specimen. This however limits the applicability of the experiment to simulations for which pre-defined kinematics and kinetics can be measured in vivo. In this study we introduce inertial control as a new methodology for gait simulations that omits the need for pre-defined setpoints for the externally applied vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and therefore allows the effect of interventions to be reflected upon it. Gait simulations of stance (1 s) were performed in 10 cadaveric specimens under three clinically relevant conditions: native ankle, total ankle prosthesis (TAP) and total ankle prosthesis plus triple arthrodesis (TAP+TA). In the native ankle, simulated vGRF was compared against the vGRF measured in vivo in 15 healthy volunteers and high correlations were found (R(2)=0.956, slope of regression line S=1.004). In TAP and TAP+TA, vGRF changed, therefore confirming the sensitivity of the method to kinematic constrains imposed with surgery. Inertial control can replicate in vivo kinetic conditions and allows investigating the isolated effect of surgical interventions on kinematic as well as kinetics.||||Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

European nondesigner surgeon studies reviewing the HINTEGRA TAR system are scarce in the literature. The present study is a European nondesigner surgeon study reviewing a consecutive series of 50 HINTEGRA TAR systems with a minimum follow-up of 2 years, focusing on clinical and radiographic outcomes.
Fifty primary TAR procedures were performed between February 2008 and January 2012 by a single surgeon. Every patient underwent a standardized clinical and radiographic follow-up at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively and annually thereafter. The mean time to final follow-up was 45 months.
The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale score significantly increased from 43.5 preoperatively to 83.8 postoperatively. Clinical range of motion of the ankle also improved from 23.3 degrees preoperatively to 28.3 degrees postoperatively. In 70% of the TAR procedures, the talar component was positioned anteriorly with respect to the tibial axis. Radiological evidence of osteolysis was identified in 24 ankles. The failure rate in the present series was 10%, which was defined as having major revision surgery within 4 years.
The survival of the first 50 HINTEGRA TAR systems in this series was satisfactory from clinical and radiological points of view. However, the incidence of asymptomatic periprosthetic osteolytic lesions was quite high (24 ankles).

American volume|"There has been a continuing increase in the use of total ankle arthroplasty for the treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis. Our aim was to determine the clinical, radiographic, and functional outcomes of total ankle arthroplasties done with a prosthesis with a modular intramedullary stem and intramedullary referencing to align the tibia.
A consecutive series of patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty with the INBONE Total Ankle Replacement from June 2007 to December 2010 were enrolled in this study. Pain and patient-reported function were assessed with use of a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. Objective function was measured with assessment of walking speed, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the Sit-to-Stand (STS) test, and the Four Square Step Test (4SST). Standardized weight-bearing radiographs obtained preoperatively and after total ankle arthroplasty were evaluated. We analyzed clinical, functional, and radiographic measurements with a series of repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with post-hoc testing to assess differences between preoperative, one-year postoperative, and most recent follow-up data. On the basis of the number of statistical comparisons, a Bonferroni correction was completed (alpha < 0.003).
We identified 194 primary INBONE total ankle arthroplasties with a mean duration of clinical follow-up of 3.7 years (range, 2.2 to 5.5 years). Patients demonstrated a significant improvement (p < 0.003) in VAS pain, AOFAS, SMFA, and SF-36 scores at the time of final follow-up, compared with preoperative values, and in walking speed, STS time, TUG time, and 4SST time at two years postoperatively, compared with preoperatively. The mean coronal tibiotalar angle for varus and valgus ankles significantly improved postoperatively and was maintained until the time of final follow-up. The prevalence of unstable subsidence leading to impending failure was 5%, and the prevalence of revision was 6%.
Patients who underwent total ankle arthroplasty with the INBONE Total Ankle Replacement demonstrated significant improvement in radiographic, functional, and patient-reported outcome scores at a mean of 3.7 years postoperatively. The overall implant survival rate was 89%.

Ankle arthroplasty via artificial or ""biological"" reconstruction is a viable option in those patients who are not comfortable with arthrodesis. More functional studies are needed to compare the performance and outcomes of the two function-preserving arthroplasties.
In this study two groups of 10 patients affected by severe ankle arthritis were treated either with a 3-component ankle prosthesis or with bipolar fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation. Patients were evaluated pre-operatively and at 5-year follow-up. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score was used for clinical evaluation, and gait analysis for functional assessment. Activation pattern of lower limb muscles was obtained by surface electromyography (EMG). In each group, kinematic, kinetic, and EMG data were compared between pre-op and follow-up assessments, and also versus corresponding data from a 20 healthy subject control group. The median clinical score significantly increased between pre-op and follow-up from 53 to 74.5 in the transplantation and from 28.5 to 80 in the prosthesis group. Spatio-temporal parameters showed a statistically significant improvement in cadence and cycle time. Improvement of gait speed was also observed only in the prosthesis group. EMG patterns at follow-up were strongly correlated with the corresponding control data for both groups. Although no significant amelioration in the joints' range of motion was detected in either surgical procedure, preservation of the functional conditions at medium-term, along with significant improvement of the clinical score, may be considered a positive outcome for both techniques."||||Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary objective of this study was to detect any large periprosthetic cysts in a cohort of AKILE™ patients using radiographs and CT scans, and then to compare these findings to published ones.
A total of 127 TAR procedures were performed between June 1995 and January 2012. We retrospectively reviewed 68 cases with the newest AKILE™ implant design that had a minimum follow-up of 36 months. The average follow-up was 81 ± 33 months; eight patients were lost to follow-up. The outcomes consisted of analyzing radiographs (A/P and lateral weight bearing views, Meary view and lateral views of flexion/extension) and helical CT scans, performing clinical evaluations (range of motion, AOFAS score, Foot Function Index, pain levels) and determining the survivorship of TAR implants.
TAR survival at 5 years was 79% for in situ implants and 62% for revision-free implants. The AOFAS score improved from 33.7 ± 14.7 to 77.1 ± 15.1 (out of 100) and the pain sub-score was 30.2 ± 9.7 (out of 40) at the last follow-up. The average ankle range of motion was 32.3° ± 12.7° on the radiographs. CT scan revealed Type A cysts (<200 mm(2)) under the talar implant in 52% of cases and in the tibia in 50% of cases; these cysts were smaller than 100 mm(2) in 80% of cases and had no effect on the implants. No periprosthetic cysts larger than 400 mm(2) in size were identified.
The medium-term functional results and survivorship are comparable to those reported for other TAR designs. The incidence of cysts was low overall and there were no large-diameter cysts, which should improve long-term survival. The implant's design and materials likely played a role in preserving the periprosthetic bone stock. The AKILE™ TAR has distinctive features related to the low rate of large periprosthetic cysts in the medium-term.

We identified 173 patients who underwent unilateral TAR between 2004 and 2011 with a minimum of two years' follow-up. There were 88 male (50.9%) and 85 female (49.1%) patients with a mean age of 66 years (sd 7.9, 43 to 84). There were 43 diabetic patients, including 25 with controlled diabetes and 18 with uncontrolled diabetes, and 130 non-diabetic patients. The clinical data which were analysed included the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, as well the incidence of peri-operative complications. The mean AOS and AOFAS scores were significantly better in the non-diabetic group (p = 0.018 and p = 0.038, respectively). In all, nine TARs (21%) in the diabetic group had clinical failure at a mean follow-up of five years (24 to 109), which was significantly higher than the rate of failure of 15 (11.6%) in the non-diabetic group (p = 0.004). The uncontrolled diabetic subgroup had a significantly poorer outcome than the non-diabetic group (p = 0.02), and a higher rate of delayed wound healing. The incidence of early-onset osteolysis was higher in the diabetic group than in the non-diabetic group (p = 0.02). These results suggest that diabetes mellitus, especially with poor glycaemic control, negatively affects the short- to mid-term outcome after TAR.||||©2014 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.|10.1302/0301-620X.96B12.34364|2014-12-03|[{'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'W J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': 'Yonsei University College of Medicine , Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'J S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Sewoori Spine and Joint Hospital, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Daejeon, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Yonsei University College of Medicine , Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'J H', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Yonsei University College of Medicine , Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'J W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Yonsei University College of Medicine , Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Seoul, 120-752, South Korea.'}]

The aim of this study is to develop a scenario for force-controlled testing and wear testing of total ankle replacements. A force-controlled wear test was developed: based on cadaver measurements, the passive stabilization (ligaments and soft tissue) of the ankle joint was characterized and a restraint model for ankle stabilization was developed. Kinematics and kinetics acting at the replaced ankle joint were defined based on literature data and gait analysis. Afterwards, force-controlled wear testing was carried out on a mobile, three-component, total ankle replacement design. Wear was assessed gravimetrically and wear particles were analyzed. Wear testing resulted in a mean wear rate of 18.2±1.4mm(3)/10(6) cycles. Wear particles showed a mean size of 0.23μm with an aspect ratio of 1.61±0.96 and a roundness of 0.62±0.14. Wear testing of total ankle replacement shows that a relevant wear mass is generated with wear particles in a biologically relevant size range.

659|25378503|Outcome of total ankle arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and noninflammatory arthritis. A multicenter cohort study comparing clinical outcome and safety.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often have degeneration of the ankle and ipsilateral hindfoot joints. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing total ankle arthroplasty have a higher risk of wound breakdown and infection. We compared intermediate-term clinical outcomes after total ankle arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and patients with noninflammatory arthritis.
Fifty patients with rheumatoid arthritis were compared with fifty patients with noninflammatory arthritis (the control group), matched for age within ten years, prosthesis type, and follow-up time. All patients underwent total ankle arthroplasty. Revisions and major complications were noted. Outcome scores included the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey.
The groups were similar with respect to body mass index and length of follow-up (mean, 63.8 months for the rheumatoid arthritis group and 65.6 months for noninflammatory arthritis group); the rheumatoid arthritis group was younger (mean, 58.5 years compared with 61.2 years). The mean AOS pain scores were significantly different in the rheumatoid arthritis and noninflammatory arthritis groups preoperatively (p < 0.01), but were similar following total ankle arthroplasty (mean and standard deviation, 18.5 ± 17.8 for the rheumatoid arthritis group and 19.7 ± 16.5 for the noninflammatory arthritis group; p = 0.93). Both groups showed significant improvement (p < 0.05) with regard to the AOS scores for pain and disability and SF-36 physical component summary scores following surgery. Postoperatively, AOS disability and SF-36 physical component summary scores were better for patients with noninflammatory arthritis. There were seven revisions in the rheumatoid arthritis group and five in noninflammatory arthritis group. There was one major wound complication in the rheumatoid arthritis cohort and none in the control cohort.
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis benefit from total ankle arthroplasty and have similar outcomes to patients with noninflammatory arthritis. The overall pain and disability were worse for patients with rheumatoid arthritis than for those with noninflammatory arthritis preoperatively, but this did not negatively influence their final outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to compare their clinical and radiographic results.
A retrospective analysis was performed using 2 validated scores and assessment of radiographic union by comparing 23 patients who underwent salvage ankle arthrodesis (group SA = salvage arthrodesis) after failed total ankle replacement with 23 matched patients who received primary ankle arthrodesis (group PA = primary arthrodesis). The mean follow-up period was 38 (range 16-92) months in group SA and 56 (23-94) months in group PA.
Complete union was achieved in 17 patients (74%) after a mean time of 50 (13- 114) weeks in group SA and in 16 patients (70%) after a mean time of 23 (10-115) weeks in group PA. The SF-36 score averaged 48 points (7-80) in SA and 66 points (14-94; P = .006) in group PA. In group SA the mean FFI was 57% (22-82) for pain and 71% (44-98) for function. In group PA significantly better results for pain with 34% (0-88; P = .002) and function with 48% (1-92; P = .002) were found.
Salvage arthrodesis led to impaired life quality and reduced function combined with significantly higher pain when compared with primary ankle arthrodesis. These findings can be used to counsel our patients preoperatively.

Arthrodesis is the most common salvage procedure for a failed total ankle replacement. There are several arthrodesis techniques each with its advantages and disadvantages. We present a technique of ankle arthrodesis for failed total ankle replacements using tantalum Trabecular Metal™ (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) with internal fixation, thus sparing the subtalar joint.
Three patients who had undergone arthrodesis for a failed total ankle replacement using tantalum Trabecular Metal were retrospectively reviewed. The mean follow-up period was 57 (range, 31-86) months. The mean age at ankle arthroplasty was 57 (range, 33-72) years and at ankle arthrodesis was 63 (range, 44-74) years. The mean time from arthroplasty to arthrodesis was 7 (range, 2-11) years.
The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score improved from 30.7 (range, 20-39) preoperatively to 72.7 (range, 65-77) postoperatively at the time of last follow-up. Arthrodesis was achieved at a mean of 3 months, and there were no complications.
The technique described has several advantages when compared to other methods of salvage ankle arthrodesis. The subtalar joint is not included in the fusion unless it is degenerative and symptomatic. Height of the ankle is maintained throughout the fusion process. Furthermore, Trabecular Metal is abundantly available; it avoids donor site morbidity and eliminates the risk of transmissible diseases."|The technique described has several advantages when compared to other methods of salvage ankle arthrodesis.

Highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXPE) was introduced to improve these outcomes, and has been shown to result in improved wear performance in several joint replacement systems. However, bearing couples within total ankle replacement (TAR) systems have historically used conventional polyethylene (CPE) articulating on metal. The extent to which HXPE would result in a reduction of polyethylene wear compared to CPE in the ankle has not been studied. The hypothesis motivating this study was that use of HXPE within TAR will result in significantly lower wear rate than CPE.
HXPE and CPE inserts within a semiconstrained, bicondylar TAR system were manufactured for this study. Samples were subjected to 5.0 million cycles of wear on an in vitro wear simulator. Testing was performed within a physiological environment, using kinematic and kinetic loading profiles characteristic of walking gait. Samples were weighed at regular intervals to determine gravimetric mass loss, and the morphology of wear particles was analyzed.
The wear rates for CPE and HXPE samples were 7.4 ± 1.3 and 1.9 ± 0.3 mg/Mc (mean ± SD), respectively. HXPE samples exhibited a significant (P < .01) wear rate reduction of 74% when compared with the CPE. Debris morphology trends between HXPE and CPE were consistent with what has been observed in other joint systems.
Use of HXPE significantly reduces wear of TAR as compared to CPE, based on in vitro wear testing.

The availability of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) to patients with end-stage ankle arthritis is often restricted because of prosthesis cost. Ankle fusion (AF) is often offered as the only alternative. Patients should have equal access to procedures that are equivalent in total cost. We compared total costs of TAA, AF, THA, and TKA for similar cohorts in a government-funded teaching hospital.
A subset of 13 TAA and 13 AF patients were selected from the Canadian Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Prospective Ankle Reconstruction Database, and 13 THA and 13 TKA patients were randomly selected from the Canadian Joint Replacement Registry. Total cost was estimated from operating room time, hospital stay, surgeon billing, and equipment used.
Mean total cost associated with TAA was $13,500 ± 1000 and was the same as THA ($14,500 ± 1500) and TKA ($12,500 ± 1000). Mean total cost associated with AF was significantly less at $5500 ± 500. Mean operating room time was longer, but mean hospital stay was shorter for the ankle procedures compared with THA and TKA.
All arthroplasties had similar total costs. Total ankle arthroplasty should not be denied based on prosthetic cost alone, as total procedure cost is equivalent to THA and TKA.

Arthrodeses of the ankle joint are performed almost three times more often. This may be due to the availability of the procedure - more than twice as many providers perform arthrodesis - as well as the postulated high frequency of revision procedures of arthroplasties in the literature. In those publications, however, there is often no clear differentiation between revision surgery with exchange of components, subsequent interventions due to complications and subsequent surgery not associated with complications. The German Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Association's (D. A. F.) registry for total ankle replacement collects data pertaining to perioperative complications as well as cause, nature and extent of the subsequent interventions, and postoperative patient satisfaction.
The D. A. F.'s total ankle replacement register is a nation-wide, voluntary registry. After giving written informed consent, the patients can be added to the database by participating providers. Data are collected during hospital stay for surgical treatment, during routine follow-up inspections and in the context of revision surgery. The information can be submitted in paper-based or online formats. The survey instruments are available as minimum data sets or scientific questionnaires which include patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The pseudonymous clinical data are collected and evaluated at the Institute for Evaluative Research in Medicine, University of Bern/Switzerland (IEFM). The patient-related data remain on the register's module server in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The registry's methodology as well as the results of the revisions and patient satisfaction for 115 patients with a two year follow-up period are presented. Statistical analyses are performed with SAS™ (Version 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
About 2½ years after the register was launched there are 621 datasets on primary implantations, 1,427 on follow-ups and 121 records on re-operation available. 49 % of the patients received their implants due to post-traumatic osteoarthritis, 27 % because of a primary osteoarthritis and 15 % of patients suffered from a rheumatic disease. More than 90 % of the primary interventions proceeded without complications. Subsequent interventions were recorded for 84 patients, which corresponds to a rate of 13.5 % with respect to the primary implantations. It should be noted that these secondary procedures also include two-stage procedures not due to a complication. ""True revisions"" are interventions with exchange of components due to mechanical complications and/or infection and were present in 7.6 % of patients. 415 of the patients commented on their satisfaction with the operative result during the last follow-up: 89.9 % of patients evaluate their outcome as excellent or good, 9.4 % as moderate and only 0.7 % (3 patients) as poor. In these three cases a component loosening or symptomatic USG osteoarthritis was present. Two-year follow-up data using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle and Hindfoot Scale (AOFAS-AHS) are already available for 115 patients. The median AOFAS-AHS score increased from 33 points preoperatively to more than 80 points three to six months postoperatively. This increase remained nearly constant over the entire two-year follow-up period.
Covering less than 10 % of the approximately 240 providers in Germany and approximately 12 % of the annually implanted total ankle-replacements, the D. A. F.-register is still far from being seen as a national registry. Nevertheless, geographical coverage and inclusion of ""high-"" (more than 100 total ankle replacements a year) and ""low-volume surgeons"" (less than 5 total ankle replacements a year) make the register representative for Germany. The registry data show that the number of subsequent interventions and in particular the ""true revision"" procedures are markedly lower than the 20 % often postulated in the literature. In addition, a high level of patient satisfaction over the short and medium term is recorded. From the perspective of the authors, these results indicate that total ankle arthroplasty - given a correct indication and appropriate selection of patients - is not inferior to an ankle arthrodesis concerning patients' satisfaction and function. First valid survival rates can be expected about 10 years after the register's start."|"Covering less than 10 % of the approximately 240 providers in Germany and approximately 12 % of the annually implanted total ankle-replacements, the D. A. F.-register is still far from being seen as a national registry.

We conducted a case-control study to compare quality of life and functional and athletic ability.
Functional results, athletic ability, and quality of life after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) are better than after ankle arthrodesis.
Two continuous series of 59 TAAs and 46 arthrodeses (operated on between 1997 and 2009) were evaluated retrospectively using a questionnaire including the functional items of the AOFAS score, the Foot Function Index (FFI) score, the Foot Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), and the SF-36.
Eighty-three responses (79% of the overall series) were matched in two groups: 32 TAAs [age at the intervention, 51.4years (range, 21-63years); follow-up, 52.2months (range, 30-146months); age at revision, 55.8years (range, 26-67years); BMI, 27.7 (range, 21.7-36.7)] and 22 arthrodeses [age at intervention, 50.1years (range, 24-72years); follow-up 57.9months (range, 12-147months); age at revision 54.9 years (range, 31-75years); BMI, 26.8 (range, 17.6-37)] (NS on all items between the two groups). The pain results were better after TAA, but with no statistically significant difference: AOFAS pain, (/40) 28.1±8.2 vs. 24.5±9.6; FFI pain, 16.6±18.8 vs. 24.3±21.5. The overall FFI score (/100) was better (P=0.048) after TAA (16.2±16.5 vs. 24.8±18.2). The overall mean athletic level compared to the state prior to the injury was relatively low in both groups, but significantly (p=0.007) higher in the TAA group: FAAM sports score (/100), 49.5±24.4 vs. 29.8±26.2. The quality-of-life scores, SF-36 physical health, mental health, and general health were not significantly different after TAA and arthrodesis: mental health score, 63.1±14.7 vs. 57.8±21.5; physical health score, 61.3±17.8 vs. 53.7±23.9, overall score, 63.2±16.4 vs. 55.9±23.5.
Very few publications describe activities and quality of life after TAA and arthrodesis. Despite weaknesses, this comparative study demonstrates a tendency toward better functional results after TAA than after ankle arthrodesis, without the difference between the two groups being very significant. On the other hand, there was no difference in terms of quality of life. After the doubts raised by publications on severe periprosthetic osteolysis at the intermediate term with certain TAA models, these results encourage pursuit of implantation and development of TAA.

Moreover, there is increasing interest in performing these procedures in an outpatient setting. Nerve blocks are extensively used in foot and ankle surgery, and commonly used techniques include sciatic nerve block with saphenous nerve augmentation; ankle block; and local, digital, or field block. Whereas more extensive blocks are associated with increased medical risk, higher cost, and delayed ambulation, more local approaches may not provide an adequate duration of effect. EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is an extended-release local anesthetic that can be infiltrated directly into the surgical site by the orthopedic surgeon to provide continuous and effective analgesia at the site of surgical injury for up to 72 hours. Two cases that illustrate the use of EXPAREL® in foot and ankle surgery are described. The first case involves ankle replacement in an active 58-year-old man with a 20-plus-year history of arthritis. The second case involves a young woman undergoing surgery for a talar neck fracture-dislocation with an open injury, dislocated subtalar joint, avascular talus, and considerable deformity. Both patients reported excellent control of postsurgical pain. ||||||2014-10-11|[{'lastname': 'Herbst', 'firstname': 'Steven A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Central Indiana Orthopedics Center, Anderson, Indiana.'}]

Advances in total ankle implant design have renewed interest in revision TAA as an alternative to ankle arthrodesis or amputation in the management of a failed TAA. The purpose of our study was to review a series of failed Agility TAA revised to INBONE II TAA and identify reasons for revision as well as perioperative complications.
A retrospective review of 35 cases of failed Agility TAA revised to an INBONE II TAA was performed at 1 institution. Patient demographics, indications for revision, radiographs, and complications were reviewed. The average follow-up was 9.1 months (range, 0-28 months). All revisions were performed by 1 of 2 foot and ankle surgeons familiar with both prostheses.
The Agility TAA lasted a mean of 6.7 years prior to revision to an INBONE II TAA. Revision TAA was indicated due to mechanical loosening, osteolysis, periprosthetic fracture, and a dislocated prosthesis. Adjunctive procedures were performed in 31 of 35 cases. There were 6 intraoperative and 5 acute postoperative complications, leading to an overall 31.4% complication rate. There was 1 patient with continued pain postoperatively who underwent a second revision of the INBONE II 20 months postoperatively.
Revision TAA was a viable treatment option for failed TAA. A high risk of perioperative complications remains, and physicians should be aware of the challenges that occur during these procedures in order to plan for them preoperatively.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of weight-bearing digital radiography compared with 3D weight-bearing multiplanar reconstructed (MPR) fluoroscopic imaging when diagnosing periprosthetic bone cysts in patients who have undergone TAR.
Forty-two consecutive patients with a Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) were consecutively enrolled and underwent digital radiography and 3D MPR imaging in the same session. All 3D MPR images were interpreted in a blinded fashion, specifically with regard to the presence and extent of periprosthetic bone cysts. Cysts were measured in three planes whenever possible. Interrater and intrarater reliability was assessed by using Cohen kappa test, and comparisons between the two modalities were performed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemar tests.

The purpose of the present report was to determine the inter-rater and intrarater reliability of our proposed measurement technique and to assess implant migration over time. Twenty consecutive patients (aged 59.3 ± 12.2 years) who had undergone implantation with this modern, third-generation prosthetic were included. To assess implant migration, measurements were made from non-weightbearing, postoperative radiographs immediately after surgery and again at 1 year and 2 years. Implant migration was defined as a change in implant location from the immediate postoperative radiograph. The proposed measurement technique appears to be a reliable method of assessing implant migration, evidenced by the high inter-rater reliability and intrarater reliability (intraclass correlation [2,1] 0.993 and intraclass correlation [1,1] 0.997, respectively). The mean implant migration was 0.7 mm at 1 year and 1.0 mm at 2 years. Time (r = 0.42) and gender (r = 0.31) were significant predictors of implant migration (R(2) = 0.27, p = .008). Therefore, we confirmed our hypothesis that implant migration would significantly increase over time and discovered that implant migration was greater in males (1.2 ± 1.1 mm) than females (0.1 ± 0.8 mm). Given the gross stability of the implant and lack of revision within the follow-up period, the measurements obtained could serve as clinical guidelines for acceptable implant migration in the short term. To determine the thresholds correlated with implant failure, future studies with long-term follow-up are warranted.||||Copyright © 2015 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Patients received either a TAA (61 patients) or an ankle arthrodesis (16 patients). Preoperatively, at 6 months and 12 months postoperatively, patients were evaluated clinically and functionally on stairs, an inclined ramp, and an uneven surface. Patients graded their function on these surfaces using a visual analog scale (VAS) in addition to standard clinical grading scales.
There was no statistically significant difference between the patient groups preoperatively (all P > .05). Both TAA and ankle arthrodesis groups had high patient satisfaction, 3.5 and 3.4 out of 4.0, respectively.

American volume|"Design improvements have increased the success of total ankle replacement, providing patients with end-stage ankle arthritis a viable alternative to arthrodesis. However, revision rates are higher than those for hip and knee arthroplasty, with the most prevalent cause of failure being aseptic loosening. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the relative bone-implant motion patterns in two well-known total ankle replacement designs.
A custom-designed mechanical simulator applied compressive loads (up to 300 N) and bending moments (3 Nm) to six pairs of human cadaveric ankles implanted with total ankle replacements, inducing a natural range of motion about three orthogonal axes: plantar flexion-dorsiflexion, inversion-eversion, and internal-external rotation. The implants analyzed were the Agility and the STAR (Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement). The relative bone-implant motions for each implant component were measured with use of an optical motion capture system.
The Agility typically exhibited greater relative motion than the STAR, with significant differences for the tibial component in inversion-eversion (p = 0.037) and for the talar component in internal-external rotation (p = 0.039). The magnitudes of the relative motions were affected by the loading direction and by compression. The motion magnitudes were quite large, with values exceeding 1000 μm for the Agility talar component in plantar flexion-dorsiflexion and in inversion-eversion.
The greater magnitudes of relative motion in the Agility suggest that primary instability of the implant may contribute to its higher clinically observed aseptic loosening rate. Future total ankle replacement designs will require better fixation to improve outcomes. The results underscore the need to conduct preclinical biomechanical assessments of relative motion patterns in ankle replacements.
Stable initial implant fixation will likely improve clinical outcomes of total ankle replacement."|||The Agility typically exhibited greater relative motion than the STAR, with significant differences for the tibial component in inversion-eversion (p = 0.037) and for the talar component in internal-external rotation (p = 0.039).

No published data currently exist regarding ionizing radiation exposure in total ankle replacement surgery. This study quantified intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration during ankle replacement surgery and examined patient and technical factors affecting the level of exposure.
Fifty-five patients underwent ankle replacement using STAR, Salto-Talaris, or INBONE total ankles. Intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration, patient demographics, implant design, and accompanying additional procedures were documented for each case. The relationship between each relevant variable and radiation dose and time was determined.
The mean fluoroscopic dose and duration for all cases were 1.15 ± 0.84 milliGray per case and 77 ± 34 seconds per case, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the absorbed radiation dose and the duration of fluoroscopy (r = .50, P < .001). The mean fluoroscopic doses were 1.53 milliGray, 0.99 milliGray, and 0.88 milliGray for INBONE, STAR, and Salto-Talaris prostheses, respectively. Fluoroscopic dose was significantly influenced by implant design (P = .035), with implants using an intramedullary referencing guide associated with higher radiation doses. After excluding cases requiring additional procedures, the fluoroscopic time and radiation dose associated with intramedullary referencing guide implants continued to exceed those of the other implants, but the differences were no longer statistically significant (P = .22, P = .09, respectively).
The average patient radiation dose during total ankle replacement was approximately one-fifth the recommended maximum yearly radiation exposure. The radiation dose was positively associated with fluoroscopy duration. Among factors controllable by the surgeon, selection of an implant with an extramedullary alignment system and conscious effort to minimize duration of fluoroscopy can reduce harmful radiation exposure and decrease cancer risk in total ankle replacement patients and associated operating room personnel.

Orthopaedic surgeons are well equipped to evaluate and treat patients with end-stage hip or knee arthritis; however, the management of patients with ankle arthritis represents a challenge to both general orthopaedic surgeons and to the foot and ankle surgeons to whom these patients are often referred. Although techniques for both hip and knee arthroplasty have evolved to provide long-term pain relief and functional improvement, neither ankle arthrodesis nor arthroplasty has demonstrated comparably favorable outcomes in long-term follow-up studies. Early ankle arthroplasty designs with highly constrained cemented components were abandoned due to unacceptably high failure rates and complications. While arthrodesis is still considered the ""gold standard"" for treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis, progression of adjacent joint arthrosis and diminished gait efficiency has led to a resurgence of interest in ankle arthroplasty. Long-term outcome studies for total ankle replacement found excellent or good results in 82% of patients who received a newer generation ankle device compared with 72% if undergoing ankle fusion. Continued long-term follow-up studies are necessary, but total ankle arthroplasty has become a viable option for surgical treatment of ankle arthritis."||||||2014-08-26|[{'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'John J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sheskier', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]

They were compared to nonfracture patients to identify the associating factors. General patient characteristics were obtained through review of charts. All patients were implanted with SPH Contact acetabular cup and sandwich liner. Function (Harris hip score) and activity (Devane score) were recorded preoperatively and at final follow-up. Radiologically, inclination and abduction angles were measured for comparison.
The study did not show any statistical differences between fracture and nonfracture groups in age, weight or body mass index. Side, type of stem used and radiologic parameters were not also significantly different. The operation had significantly improved function and activity postoperatively in both groups, but no statistical significance was noted between the two groups exception to preoperative Harris hip score. On inspection, retrieved ceramic heads and liners showed substantial metal transfer on their surfaces, and linear wears were evident on the ceramic heads.
Compared to other studies, our series also experienced high rate of sandwich liner fracture. Though its use was generally discontinued, it is worrisome to note that failure rate of the liner will substantially increase over time."|||The study did not show any statistical differences between fracture and nonfracture groups in age, weight or body mass index.

The usual practice is to use bulk grafts which are either autografts or allografts to fill the defect. We report our experience with the use of a titanium foam block specifically designed for fusion of failed ankle replacements. This particular method was chosen to avoid the technical difficulties and morbidities associated with the use of bulk autografts and allografts. We describe the surgical technique and early results in the first two cases performed in our unit. The satisfactory clinical and radiologic results in the two cases demonstrate the ability of the titanium foam block to simplify an otherwise complex procedure without compromising the outcome. ||||Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

689|24951733|Patient-Reported Outcomes, Function, and Gait Mechanics After Fixed and Mobile-Bearing Total Ankle Replacement.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"The popularity of total ankle replacement as a treatment for end-stage arthritis continues to grow. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in ankle kinetics and kinematics from a preoperative time point through two years postoperatively in patients who had received either a fixed-bearing or a mobile-bearing implant.
Ninety patients who received a primary total ankle replacement (forty-nine mobile-bearing and forty-one fixed-bearing) were examined. Three-dimensional joint mechanics and ground reaction forces were measured during level walking preoperatively and one and two years postoperatively. Patient-reported and functional outcomes were also collected. Data were analyzed with use of a 3 × 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine significant differences between implant types and across time (α = 0.05).
No significant difference was observed in the ankle motion or step time between implant types or across time. However, there was a greater increase in the peak plantar flexion moment and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) total score across time in the fixed-bearing group than in the mobile-bearing group. Conversely, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores exhibited greater improvement in the mobile-bearing group than in the fixed-bearing group. Independent of implant type, a significant improvement was observed in walking speed, results of the functional tests, spatiotemporal variables, patient-reported outcomes, and vertical ground reaction forces. Independent of time, the fixed-bearing group demonstrated a significant increase in both the weight-acceptance and the propulsion ground reaction forces compared with the mobile-bearing group. The mobile-bearing group completed the Sit-to-Stand test significantly faster.
All of the observed changes suggest improved or maintenance of function following total ankle replacement. In general, the group with a fixed-bearing implant demonstrated improvements in ankle moment and ground reaction forces, while the mobile-bearing-implant group demonstrated improvements in patient-reported pain outcome. There were few significant changes between the two implant types.

The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in outcomes between patients who had a concomitant triceps surae lengthening (gastrocnemius recession [GSR] or triple hemisection [TAL]) versus a group that underwent TAR alone preoperatively and 1 year after TAR.
For this prospective, nonrandomized study, 229 patients (37 GSR, 22 TAL, and 170 TAR alone) were examined. Patient-reported outcomes, physical performance, and lower extremity gait mechanics were completed preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. A series of repeated measures ANOVAs were used to determine significant differences (P < .05), and Tukey's post hoc testing was used to follow any significant ANOVA results.
No difference existed in BMI, age, gender, or dorsiflexion (DF) angle at heel strike between the triceps surae lengthening groups or between preoperative and 1 year following TAR. Walking speed, the physical performance measures, the AOFAS Hindfoot Score, SF-36, peak plantar flexion angle, and the peak plantar flexion moment were significantly improved (P < .001) postoperatively with no differences between the triceps surae lengthening groups. The peak DF angle (P = .006) and the ankle range of motion (P = .014) demonstrated a greater improvement from preoperative to 1 year postoperatively in the triceps surae lengthening groups in comparison to the TAR alone group.

We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 1998 to 2010 to examine time trends in the utilization rates of TAA. We used the Cochran Armitage test for trend to assess time trends across the years and the analysis of variance (ANOVA), Wilcoxon test, or chi-squared test (as appropriate) to compare the first (1998-2000) and the last time periods (2009-2010). TAA utilization rate increased significant from 1998 to 2010: 0.13 to 0.84 per 100,000 overall, 0.14 to 0.88 per 100,000 in females, and from 0.11 to 0.81 per 100,000 in males (p < 0.0001 for each comparison for time trends). Compared to the 1998-2000 period, those undergoing TAA in 2009-2010 were older (41% fewer patients <50 years, p < 0.0001), less likely to have rheumatoid arthritis as the underlying diagnosis (55% fewer patients, p = 0.0001), more likely to have Deyo-Charlson index of 2 or more (197% more, p = 0.0010), and had a shorter length of stay at 2.5 days (17% reduction, p < 0.0001). Mortality was rare ranging from 0 to 0.6% and discharge to inpatient facility ranged 12.6-14.1%; we noted no significant time trends in either (p > 0.05). The utilization rate of TAA increased rapidly in the USA from 1998 to 2010, but post-arthroplasty mortality rate was stable. Underlying diagnosis and medical comorbidity changed over time and both can impact outcomes after TAA. Further studies should examine how the outcomes and complications of TAA have evolved over time.|||||10.1007/s10067-014-2703-2|2014-06-08|[{'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Jasvinder A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Birmingham VA Medical Center, Birmingham, AL, USA.

It is not clear whether an algorithm developed for hip and knee PJI can be used in the management of PJI of the ankle. We evaluated the outcome, at two or more years post-operatively, in 34 patients with PJI of the ankle, identified from a cohort of 511 patients who had undergone total ankle replacement. Their median age was 62.1 years (53.3 to 68.2), and 20 patients were women. Infection was exogenous in 28 (82.4%) and haematogenous in six (17.6%); 19 (55.9%) were acute infections and 15 (44.1%) chronic. Staphylococci were the cause of 24 infections (70.6%). Surgery with retention of one or both components was undertaken in 21 patients (61.8%), both components were replaced in ten (29.4%), and arthrodesis was undertaken in three (8.8%). An infection-free outcome with satisfactory function of the ankle was obtained in 23 patients (67.6%). The best rate of cure followed the exchange of both components (9/10, 90%). In the 21 patients in whom one or both components were retained, four had a relapse of the same infecting organism and three had an infection with another organism. Hence the rate of cure was 66.7% (14 of 21). In these 21 patients, we compared the treatment given to an algorithm developed for the treatment of PJI of the knee and hip. In 17 (80.9%) patients, treatment was not according to the algorithm. Most (11 of 17) had only one criterion against retention of one or both components. In all, ten of 11 patients with severe soft-tissue compromise as a single criterion had a relapse-free survival. We propose that the treatment concept for PJI of the ankle requires adaptation of the grading of quality of the soft tissues.||||©2014 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.|10.1302/0301-620X.96B6.33298|2014-06-04|[{'lastname': 'Kessler', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Basel University Medical Clinic Liestal, Interdisciplinary Unit for Orthopaedic Infections, Kantonsspital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Knupp', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology, Interdisciplinary Unit for Orthopaedic Infections, Kantonsspital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Graber', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Basel University Medical Clinic Liestal, Interdisciplinary Unit for Orthopaedic Infections, Kantonsspital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Zwicky', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology, Interdisciplinary Unit for Orthopaedic Infections, Kantonsspital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hintermann', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology, Interdisciplinary Unit for Orthopaedic Infections, Kantonsspital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Zimmerli', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Basel University Medical Clinic Liestal, Interdisciplinary Unit for Orthopaedic Infections, Kantonsspital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sendi', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland.'}]

Pain, function, and disability significantly improved postoperatively from 1 to 2 years (p ≤ .008) and from 1 to 3 years (p ≤ .008). The reductions in pain, functional impairment, and disability were maintained from 2 to 3 years (p ≥ .08). Nine complications (39.1%) were encountered: 1 deep infection, 2 pulmonary embolisms, 3 wounds, 1 ectopic bone formation, 1 stiff joint, and 1 talar subsidence. In the 3-year follow-up period, 3 patients (13.0%) required additional procedures after the immediate postoperative phase. Our results have demonstrated that modular stem fixed-bearing prostheses can be implanted in a predictable and consistent fashion with resultant improvements in pain, function, and disability.

In cases involving ankle bone loss, such as in failed total ankle replacement, it can be difficult to salvage with sufficient bone restoration stability and a physiologic leg length and avoiding below the knee amputation. In addition to the alternatives of using a structural allograft or metal bone substitution, we describe the use of autologous ipsilateral circular pillar fibula augmentation in tibiotalocalcaneal retrograde nail arthrodesis combined with a ventral (anterior) plate in a prospective series of 6 consecutive cases with a mean follow-up duration of 26 ± 9.95 (range 12 to 34) months.

The visual analog scale for pain and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score were used to assess functional outcome, and radiographs and computed tomography scans were used to determine the presence of fusion. All patients improved clinically from pre- to postoperatively in regard to the mean pain visual analog scale score (from 7.5 to 2.0) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score (from 29 to 65 points, of an 86-point maximum for fused joints). Radiologically, no loss in the reduction or misalignment of the hindfoot was detected, and all cases fused solid. One patient (16.67%) required hardware removal. The fixation construct provided good clinical and radiologic outcomes, and we recommend it as an alternative to structural allografts or metallic bone grafts for revision ankle surgery with severe bone loss.||||Copyright © 2014 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

For the first time, this technology was applied to total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). This study evaluated repeatability of tibia and talus patient-specific guide placement and deviation between the preoperative plan and actual implant placement.
Routine ankle CT scans were acquired of 15 cadaveric lower extremity limbs, converted into 3D solid models, and imported into a computer-assisted design assembly. Anatomic landmarks defining tibia/talus alignment were established and used to perform a virtual TAA. Commercially available implant components were placed to mimic traditional cases. An operative guide referencing the cadaver-specific anatomy was engineered to define the resection planes necessary to re-create virtual placement of traditional tibia and talus implants in the postoperative position. Board-certified TAA orthopaedic surgeons with no prior preoperative navigation experience placed the operative guides onto the bones based on tactile and visual feedback. Guide placement was repeated 4 times to determine variability. Final implant position was recorded with an infrared probe, confirmed with CT scans, and compared to the preoperative plan. Average deviations between planned and actual guide placement were determined for all rotational and translational degrees of freedom (DOF). In addition, implant component location was measured radiographically.
Intraobserver tibia and talus guide variation between all trials was 0.26 ± 0.18 degrees and 0.36 ± 0.25 degrees in flexion/extension, 0.61 ± 0.58 and 0.53 ± 0.53 in varus/valgus, and 0.79 ± 0.38 degrees and 1.15 ± 0.77 degrees in internal/external rotation, respectively. Average variation between preoperative and postoperative implant placement was less than 2 degrees and 1.4 mm in all specimens tested.
Preliminary data suggest that preoperative navigation and custom operative guides result in reliable and reproducible placement of TAA implants and patient-specific ankle alignment. Deviation of final implant placement from the preoperative plan was less than 2 degrees in all angular DOF, providing greater accuracy than the ±3 degrees determined in other implant system studies using traditional instrumentation and computer navigation.
We have further demonstrated that final implant position is successfully guided by these patient-specific guides, with reproducibility of tibial component placement falling within 2 degrees of the intended target. This level of reproducibility suggests a promise for this technology, and it is hoped this level of accuracy will become the benchmark for the next generation of total ankle arthroplasty."|Preliminary data suggest that preoperative navigation and custom operative guides result in reliable and reproducible placement of TAA implants and patient-specific ankle alignment.

700|24695930|Two-year outcomes of MOBILITY Total Ankle Replacement.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"There is little literature on patient-reported outcomes following total ankle replacement in patients with osteoarthritis, posttraumatic osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. We compared the differences in demographic data and clinical and patient-reported outcomes among patients with those types of arthritis who underwent total ankle replacement performed with use of the MOBILITY Total Ankle System.
Patients were divided into three groups based on the preoperative diagnosis of type of arthritis. We analyzed patient demographic data, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, and patient-reported outcomes as measured with use of the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), the 36-item Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey, and patient-satisfaction scores, collected preoperatively and at one and two years postoperatively.
The study included 106 consecutive patients who underwent total ankle replacement between March 2006 and December 2009. The posttraumatic osteoarthritis group, which had twenty-eight patients, was significantly younger (mean age, 54.8 yrs; p < 0.05) than the other groups; the rheumatoid arthritis group, which had twenty-two patients, had a significantly lower mean body mass index (24.5 kg/m(2); p < 0.05); and the osteoarthritis group, which had fifty-six patients, had a higher proportion of males (41 males; p < 0.05). The posttraumatic osteoarthritis group reported better scores for two of the eight domains of the SF-36 preoperatively. At one year postoperatively, the posttraumatic osteoarthritis group and the rheumatoid arthritis group had better FAOS results regarding pain than those of the osteoarthritis group, and the posttraumatic osteoarthritis group also reported better scores for the general health domain of the SF-36. At two years, the posttraumatic group continued to show significantly higher scores for the general health domain of the SF-36. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the AOFAS scores, other FAOS results, or the patient-satisfaction scores at one and two years postoperatively.

703|24599201|Risks to the blood supply of the talus with four methods of total ankle arthroplasty: a cadaveric injection study.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Despite the use of contemporary total ankle arthroplasty implant designs, clinical outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty continue to lag behind those of other joint replacement procedures. Disruption of the extraosseous talar blood supply at the time of ankle replacement may be a factor contributing to talar component subsidence-a common mechanism of early failure following ankle replacement. We evaluated the risk of injury to specific extraosseous arteries supplying the talus associated with specific total ankle arthroplasty implants.
Sixteen fresh-frozen through-knee cadaveric specimens were injected with latex and barium sulfate distal to the popliteal trifurcation to visualize the arteries. Four specimens each were prepared for implantation of four contemporary total ankle arthroplasty systems: Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR), INBONE II, Salto Talaris, and Trabecular Metal Total Ankle (TMTA). Postoperative computed tomography scans and 6% sodium hypochlorite chemical debridement were used to examine, measure, and document the proximity of the total ankle arthroplasty instrumentation to the extraosseous talar blood supply.
All four implant types subjected the extraosseous talar blood supply to the risk of injury. The INBONE subtalar drill hole directly transected the artery of the tarsal canal in three of four specimens. The lateral approach for the TMTA transected the first perforator of the peroneal artery in two of four specimens. The STAR caused medial injury to the deltoid branches in all four specimens, whereas the other three systems did not directly affect this supply (p < 0.005). The Salto Talaris and STAR implants caused injury to the artery of the tarsal canal in one of four specimens.

704|24589152|Total ankle replacement in patients with haemophilia and virus infections--a safe alternative to ankle arthrodesis?|['arthropathy', 'haemophilia', 'total ankle replacement']|Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia|Despite reliable results of ankle fusion for advanced haemophilic arthropathy, total ankle replacement (TAR) may be functionally advantageous. There is only very limited literature data available on TAR in patients with haemophilia. The objective of this study is to evaluate the short- and mid-term results after TAR in patients with end-stage haemophilic ankle arthropathy and concomitant virus infections. In a retrospective study, results after eleven TAR in 10 patients with severe (n = 8) and moderate (n = 2) haemophilia (mean age: 49 ± 7 years, range, 37-59) were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 3.0 years (range, 1.2-5.4). Nine patients were positive for hepatitis C, five were HIV-positive. Range of motion (ROM), AOFAS-hindfoot-score, pain status (visual analogue scale, VAS) as well as patient satisfaction were evaluated. In two cases deep prosthesis infection occurred leading to the removal of the implant. In the remaining eight patients the mean AOFAS score improved significantly from 21.5 to 68.0 points (P < 0.0005), the VAS score decreased significantly from 7.6 to 1.9 points (P < 0.0005). ROM increased from 23.2 to 25.0 degrees (P = 0.51). At final follow-up all patients without any complications were satisfied with the postoperative results. Radiographic examination did not reveal any signs of prosthetic loosening. TAR is a viable surgical treatment option in patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis due to haemophilia. It provides significant pain relieve and high patient satisfaction. However, due to the increased risk of infection and lack of long-term results, TAR particularly in patients with severe haemophilia and virus infections should be indicated carefully. ||||© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.|10.1111/hae.12392|2014-03-05|[{'lastname': 'Strauss', 'firstname': 'A C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldmann', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wessling', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gravius', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Müller', 'firstname': 'M C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wimmer', 'firstname': 'M D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wirtz', 'firstname': 'D C', 'initials': 'DC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Oldenburg', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Pennekamp', 'firstname': 'P H', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': None}]

Although replacement devices fail by a number of mechanisms, wear in the polyethylene liner constitutes one of the dominating failure modes. This leads to instability and loosening of the implant. Mechanisms that contribute to wear in the liners are high contact and subsurface stresses that break down the material over time. Therefore, it is important to understand the gait that generates these stresses. Methods to characterize and decrease wear in Ohio Total Ankle Replacements (TARs) have been performed in this research. This research utilizes finite element analysis of Wright State University (WSU) patented TAR models. From the Finite element analysis (FEA) results, mathematical models of contact conditions and wear mechanics were developed. The maximum wear rate values obtained in the study (at 25.598MPa, 3.74mm(3)/year) and maximum surface Mises stress obtained with new optimization model (11.52MPa) seem to be comparable with the maximum wear values obtained in other similar studies. These models were used to determine the best methods for wear characterization and reduction. Furthermore, optimization models were developed based on geometry of the implants. These equations optimize geometry, thus congruency and anatomical simulations for total ankle implants. ||||Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Data was analyzed using a 2×3 repeated measures ANOVA to determine significant differences between limbs and across time points (α=0.05).
Walking speed improved from pre-operative to each post-operative time point (P<.001; ES=1.5). Peak dorsiflexion was not changed across time or between sides, however, the dorsiflexion angle at heel strike was increased on the nonsurgical side (P=0.049; ES=0.32). Peak plantar flexion moment (P<.001; ES=.80), stance (P<.001; ES=.29) and step time (P<.001; ES=.41) were improved from pre-op to 1year post-surgery on the surgical side. Step (P<.001; ES=1.2) and stride length (P<.001; ES=1.2) demonstrated improvements across all time points, while the weight acceptance (P<.001; ES=.27) and propulsion ground reaction forces (P<.001; ES=.22) showed improvements between pre-op and 1year post-op.
The results of the study indicate that the patients are able to walk faster and demonstrate an improvement in gait symmetry; however, this improvement does not return the patient to a symmetric walking pattern by 2years post-TAR."||||Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A 3-grade classification of complications to assist in prediction of early implant failure has been proposed. We have compared the experience of a tertiary referral center in the United Kingdom to the proposed system.
A retrospective review of the Sheffield Foot and Ankle Unit TAR database was performed from 1995 to 2010. All complications were recorded and categorized using Glazebrook et al's proposed system of increasing severity. Low-grade complications including postoperative bone fracture, intraoperative bone fracture, and wound healing problems rarely lead to revision. Medium-grade complications, technical error and subsidence, lead to failure <50% of the time. High-grade complications--deep infection, aseptic loosening, and implant failure--lead to revision >50% of the time. In our center, 217 TAR were implanted in 198 patients with a minimum follow-up of 30 months.
The complication rate was 23%, with a revision rate of 17%. All complications recorded in our study except intraoperative bone fracture and wound healing had a failure rate of at least 50%.
Unfortunately most complications associated with TAR have a significant impact on the life span of a TAR. Glazebrook et al's proposed 3-tier system did not reliably reflect our experience. Hence, we would categorize complications as either high or low risk for early failure of TAR.

When talocalcaneal joint was fused, whether operatively or spontaneously, ankle kinematics would be affected. The purpose of this paper was to study in vivo kinematics of mobile-bearing total ankle replacement (TAR) in rheumatoid ankle with concomitant talocalcaneal arthrodesis or with preexisting spontaneous talocalcaneal fusion.
Thirteen TARs in ten patients with RA, in whom talocalcaneal joints had already been fused spontaneously or surgically, were studied. Fluoroscopic images were obtained while each patient was walking with full weightbearing on the implanted ankle. Thereafter tibio-talar motion was analyzed by 2D/3D registration technique.
Average tibio-talar motion was 4.0 ± 5.3° for plantarflexion and 6.6 ± 0.3° for dorsiflexion. Average range of internal/external rotation, inversion/eversion and AP translation was 3.8 ± 1.3°, 2.7 ± 1.0° and 1.6 ± 0.6 mm, respectively.
Mobility of mobile-bearing TAR with talocalcaneal fusion was small during the stance phase of gait, but clinically measured ROM was mostly preserved.

Therefore, we evaluated the resection amount of PCL attachment and the function of the residual PCL in cruciate-retaining (CR)-type TKA.
We examined 76 patients with knee osteoarthritis who had undergone CR-type TKA. The level of the tibial PCL attachment was measured by preoperative MRI and the amount resected into the tibial PCL attachment from the osteotomy level as well as the longitudinal diameter of the residual PCL by postoperative radiography. The relationships between these and joint gap tension value at flexion or amount of tibial posterior transfer by postoperative stress radiography were examined.
The longitudinal diameter of the PCL attachment and the attachment level varied widely among patients. There were 39 patients (51%) with tibial osteotomy level caudal to the PCL attachment. Flexion gap tension in patients with residual PCL (residual PCL group) was slightly higher than those without residual PCL (fully-resected group). There was no correlation between amount of PCL residual and joint gap tension at the flexion position. Even in those without residual PCL, no correlation was observed between the resected amount and flexion joint gap tension value. Comparison of amount of posterior transfer by postoperative stress radiography between those with and without residual PCL revealed no significant difference.
It was confirmed that the level and morphology of the PCL attachment vary greatly among individuals and the amount of PCL resected at tibial osteotomy during TKA surgery varies depending on the patient.

American volume|"Surgical treatments for end-stage ankle arthritis include total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis. Although arthrodesis is a reliable procedure, ankle replacement is often preferred by patients. This prospective study evaluated intermediate-term outcomes of ankle replacement and arthrodesis in a large cohort at multiple centers, with variability in ankle arthritis type, prosthesis type, surgeon, and surgical technique. We hypothesized that patient-reported clinical outcomes would be similar for both procedures.
Patients in the Canadian Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (COFAS) Prospective Ankle Reconstruction Database were treated with total ankle replacement (involving Agility, STAR, Mobility, or HINTEGRA prostheses) or ankle arthrodesis by six subspecialty-trained orthopaedic surgeons at four centers between 2001 and 2007. Data collection included demographics, comorbidities, and the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) scores. The preoperative and latest follow-up scores for patients with at least four years of follow-up were analyzed. Sensitivity analyses excluded ankles that had undergone revision. A linear mixed-effects regression model compared scores between the groups, adjusting for age, sex, side, smoking status, body mass index, inflammatory arthritis diagnosis, baseline score, and surgeon.
Of the 388 ankles (281 in the ankle replacement group and 107 in the arthrodesis group), 321 (83%; 232 ankle replacements and eighty-nine arthrodeses) were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 5.5 ± 1.2 years. Patients treated with arthrodesis were younger, more likely to be diabetic, less likely to have inflammatory arthritis, and more likely to be smokers. Seven (7%) of the arthrodeses and forty-eight (17%) of the ankle replacements underwent revision. The major complications rate was 7% for arthrodesis and 19% for ankle replacement. The AOS total, pain, and disability scores and SF-36 physical component summary score improved between the preoperative and final follow-up time points in both groups. The mean AOS total score improved from 53.4 points preoperatively to 33.6 points at the time of follow-up in the arthrodesis group and from 51.9 to 26.4 points in the ankle replacement group. Differences in AOS and SF-36 scores between the arthrodesis and ankle replacement groups at follow-up were minimal after adjustment for baseline characteristics and surgeon.

Recent studies have shown that balancing the hindfoot with the aid of supramalleolar osteotomy (SMOT) is an effective method to decrease symptoms and to delay progression of osteoarthritis of the ankle joint. Resurfacing the articular surfaces with total ankle replacement (TAR), in contrast, may compensate for the lost joint congruency and lost stability of the talus at the peritalar joint. However, no literature exists with regard to the overall correction of talar position in all 3 planes when using these 2 treatment modalities. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of SMOT and TAR on talar position in all 3 planes, and to compare the efficiency of both procedures in restoring overall hindfoot geometry.
Out of 104 ankles with a varus-tilted ankle, 52 patients were treated with SMOT and 52 with TAR. Weight-bearing radiographs were analyzed to measure the talar position in all 3 planes, including the talar tilt angle (TT), the sagittal talocalcaneal inclination angle (TCI), and the talometatarsal 1 angle (TMT1) pre- and postoperatively.
Although after TAR the talar position was corrected in all the 3 planes, SMOT on the other hand did not fully correct the TT, and furthermore TMT1 remained unchanged.
Resurfacing of the worn-out articular surface and tensioning of ligaments, as is the case in TAR, radiographically restores the hindfoot geometry in the neutral position better than SMOT does.

The goal of this study was to develop and validate a finite element model of total ankle replacement, for future testing of hypotheses related to clinical issues. To validate the finite element model, an experimental setup was specifically developed and applied on 8 cadaveric tibias. A non-cemented press fit tibial component of a mobile bearing prosthesis was inserted into the tibias. Two extreme anterior and posterior positions of the mobile bearing insert were considered, as well as a centered one. An axial force of 2kN was applied for each insert position. Strains were measured on the bone surface using digital image correlation. Tibias were CT scanned before implantation, after implantation, and after mechanical tests and removal of the prosthesis. The finite element model replicated the experimental setup. The first CT was used to build the geometry and evaluate the mechanical properties of the tibias. The second CT was used to set the implant position. The third CT was used to assess the bone-implant interface conditions. The coefficient of determination (R-squared) between the measured and predicted strains was 0.91. Predicted bone strains were maximal around the implant keel, especially at the anterior and posterior ends. The finite element model presented here is validated for future tests using more physiological loading conditions. ||||Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

American volume|"Longer length of stay in the hospital after elective surgery results in increased use of health-care resources and higher costs. Improved perioperative care permits many foot and ankle surgical procedures to be performed as day surgery. This study determined perioperative factors associated with a longer length of stay after elective total ankle replacement or ankle arthrodesis.
Data were prospectively collected on patients who underwent open or arthroscopic ankle fusion or total ankle replacement for end-stage ankle arthritis at our institution from 2003 to 2010. Univariate and multivariable generalized linear regression models with gamma distribution and log link function were conducted with use of the length of the hospital stay as the dependent variable and preselected risk factors of age, sex, physical and mental functional scores, comorbid factors, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, body mass index, type of surgery, duration of surgery, and surgery day of the week as the independent variables.
This study included 343 patients with a median length of stay of seventy-five hours (interquartile range, fifty-two to ninety-seven hours). With use of regression analyses, the variables of age, female sex, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, multiple medical comorbidities, rheumatoid arthritis, lower Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary and General Health domain scores, and open surgery were significantly associated with increased length of stay. Conversely, the variables of obesity, Short Form-36 Mental Component Summary score, surgery day of the week, and surgical duration were not associated with length of stay. Two predictive models of the length of stay were developed: one included only patient-related factors, and the other included patient and surgery-related factors.

This study documented the incidence of heterotopic ossification in a large ankle arthroplasty series; identified potentially related patient, implant, and operative factors; and determined the strength of association of those factors with the clinical outcome. Ninety ankles in 88 primary ankle arthroplasty patients were followed for an average of 32.4 months. Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement, Salto-Talaris, and INBONE ankle implants were used at the surgeon's discretion. Heterotopic ossification was measured and classified using methods previously described for total hip arthroplasty. Incidence, location, severity, predisposing factors, and outcomes were documented, and correlation between ossification severity and each examined factor was determined. Eighty percent and 95.6% of ankles showed heterotopic ossification on anteroposterior and lateral views, respectively, and 97.8% showed evidence on either anteroposterior or lateral views. Ossification grades 4 and 3 were most common, predominantly located at the medial gutter and posterior to the tibial component. No preoperative variables were associated with heterotopic ossification, but its presence on lateral radiographs correlated with insufficient coverage of the tibial or talar component. Only three ankles required heterotopic ossification resection because of recalcitrant pain. The incidence of heterotopic ossification following primary total ankle arthroplasty was higher in this series than previously reported. ||||||2014-01-01|[{'lastname': 'Angthong', 'firstname': 'Chayanin', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Thammasat University, Klong Luang, Pathum Thani, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Adams', 'firstname': 'Samuel B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Easley', 'firstname': 'Mark E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nunley', 'firstname': 'James A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}]

Ankle moments and power in both treatment groups remained significantly lower compared with the control group (p < 0.05 between each treatment group and the control group for both variables). Gait patterns in both treatment groups were not completely normalized. Improvements in patient-reported Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale and Short Form-36 scores were similar for both treatment groups.
The gait patterns of patients following three-component, mobile-bearing total ankle arthroplasty more closely resembled normal gait when compared with the gait patterns of patients following arthrodesis. Dorsal motion in the sagittal plane was primarily responsible for the differences. Improvement in self-reported clinical outcome scores was similar for both groups. Further investigation is needed to determine why patients who have undergone total ankle arthroplasty do not use the plantar flexion motion in the terminal-stance phase and to explain the limited increase in power generation at toe-off after arthroplasty. Results obtained from this study may be used for future modifications of ankle prostheses and may add to clinicians' ability to inform patients of predicted functional outcomes prior to the treatment of end-stage ankle osteoarthritis."|||Patients who had undergone arthroplasty, when compared with patients who had undergone arthrodesis, demonstrated greater postoperative total sagittal plane motion (18.1° versus 13.7°; p < 0.05), dorsiflexion (11.9° versus 6.8°; p < 0.05), and range of tibial tilt (23.1° versus 19.1°; p < 0.05).

This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes of statistically paired series of FB and MB versions of the same ankle prosthesis.
The study was a multicenter retrospective comparison between 2 groups: the FB group of 33 consecutive Talaris cases and the MB group of 33 ""paired"" Salto cases, selected from a database of 313 consecutive cases to statistically match etiology, age, and preoperative American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. All patients were operated upon with the same operative technique and received identical pre- and postoperative clinical and radiographic assessments. The mean follow-up was 24 months for the FB group and 23 months for the MB group.
There was no statistical difference between results of the 2 groups in terms of accuracy of positioning, clinical and radiographic mobility, and morbidity. The most recent postoperative AOFAS scores were higher for the FB group than for the MB group (P = .05). Radiolucent lines were observed in 4 FB patients versus 13 MB patients (P = .02). Subchondral cysts were noted in 1 FB patient and in 8 MB patients (P = .01).
There was no notable difference in clinical performance of the FB and MB implants with the numbers available.

725|24306698|Management of failures of total ankle replacement with the agility total ankle arthroplasty.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Few studies have focused on treatment following failed total ankle replacement. The purpose of this study was to report the outcomes of patients undergoing revision total ankle replacement and to propose a talar component subsidence grading system that may be helpful in making decisions regarding how to revise failed total ankle replacements in the future.
A retrospective review was performed of fifty-three patients who underwent revision total ankle replacement and had been followed for a minimum of two years. Patients were assessed radiographically and with outcome scores. The rates of conversion to amputation or fusion were also assessed.
The mean follow-up period was 49.1 months after the revision arthroplasty. The average time from primary total ankle replacement to revision was fifty-one months. Forty-one of the fifty-three patients (77%) were available for follow-up. The revision arthroplasty had been converted to an arthrodesis in five of the forty-one patients, and two additional patients had undergone amputation. The most common indication for revision total ankle replacement was talar subsidence (63%; twenty-six of forty-one). Twenty-two patients (54%) had a subtalar arthrodesis performed at the time of the revision arthroplasty, with nineteen of those having a custom-designed long-stem talar component placed simultaneously. The mean radiographic measurements of component position did not change significantly postoperatively. The mean postoperative scores for the thirty-four patients with a retained total ankle replacement were: 4.4 of 10 possible points on a visual analog pain scale (VAS), 65 of 100 possible points on the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scale, 93.5 of 100 possible points on the Short-Form 12 (SF-12), 137.9 of 204 possible points on the Revised Foot Function Index (FFI-R), and 64 of 180 possible points on the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS). The mean arc of motion radiographically was 18° preoperatively and 23° postoperatively, with all improvement occurring in plantar flexion. A lesser amount of preoperative talar subsidence was a significant predictor of a good outcome based on the AOFAS hindfoot score (p < 0.03) and the AOS (p < 0.01) score.

The aim of this study was to assess the minimum ten-year outcome of TAR in this group of patients. We prospectively followed 76 patients (93 TARs) who underwent surgery between 1988 and 1999. No patients were lost to follow-up. At latest follow-up at a mean of 14.8 years (10.7 to 22.8), 30 patients (39 TARs) had died and the original TAR remained in situ in 28 patients (31 TARs). The cumulative incidence of failure at 15 years was 20% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11 to 28). The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score of the surviving patients at latest follow-up was 80.4 (95% CI 72 to 88). In total, 21 patients (23 TARs) underwent subsequent surgery: three implant exchanges, three bearing exchanges and 17 arthrodeses. Neither design of TAR described in this study, the LCS and the Buechel-Pappas, remains currently available. However, based both on this study and on other reports, we believe that TAR using current mobile-bearing designs for patients with end-stage arthritis of the ankle due to inflammatory joint disease remains justified.|||||10.1302/0301-620X.95B12.32146|2013-12-03|[{'lastname': 'Kraal', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Slotervaart Hospital, P.O.

There was statistically significant reduction of pain in each of four situations (i.e., rest, walking, stair climbing and running; p ≤ 0.01). The median American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score improved from 62 (interquartile range (IQR) 46 to 72) pre-operatively to 87 (IQR 75 to 95) at final follow-up (p < 0.001).

We evaluated the outcome of the two surgeries at least 2 years post rehabilitation, focusing on BGM. 36 participants, including 12 AA patients, 12 TAR patients, and 12 controls were included. Gait assessment over 50 m distance was performed utilizing pressure insoles and 3D inertial sensors, following which an intraindividual comparison was performed. Most spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters in the TAR group were indicative of good gait symmetry, while the AA group presented significant differences. Plantar pressure symmetry among the AA group was also significantly distorted. Abnormality in biomechanical behavior of the AA unoperated, contralateral foot was observed. In summary, our results indicate an altered BGM in AA patients, whereas a relatively fully recovered BGM is observed in TAR patients, despite the quantitative differences in several parameters when compared to a healthy population. Our study supports a biomechanical assessment and rehabilitation of both operated and unoperated sides after major surgeries for ankle osteoarthrosis.||||© 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society.

731|24196462|Differences in outcomes following total ankle replacement in patients with neutral alignment compared with tibiotalar joint malalignment.|[]|The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|"Excessive tibiotalar malalignment in the coronal plane has been considered by some to be a contraindication to total ankle replacement. The purpose of the present study was to compare clinical outcomes and physical performance measures according to preoperative tibiotalar alignment.
One hundred and three patients undergoing total ankle replacement were grouped according to coronal plane tibiotalar alignment. Seventeen patients had an excessive deformity (>15° of varus or valgus), twenty-one had moderate valgus alignment (5° to 15° of valgus), twenty-seven had moderate varus alignment (5° to 15° of varus), and thirty-eight had neutral alignment (<5° of varus or valgus). Outcome measures, including the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score, the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI), the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the timed up and go test (TUG), the four square step test (4SST), and walking speed, were assessed preoperatively and at one and two years after total ankle replacement.
Coronal plane alignment improved following the procedure, with 36.9% of patients having neutral alignment preoperatively as compared with 95% postoperatively. To achieve this alignment, adjunctive procedures, including deltoid ligament release, lateral ligament reconstruction, and posterior soft-tissue releases, were necessary. Significant improvements were seen for the Page: 3 AOFAS pain, function, alignment, and hindfoot scores (p < 0.001) and the SF-36 subscales of body pain, physical function, and role physical (p < 0.001) following total ankle replacement. Walking speed and the FADI, TUG, and 4SST scores also improved significantly (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated no significant differences in clinical outcomes and physical performance measures based on preoperative coronal plane alignment.
Total ankle replacement improves clinical and functional outcomes independent of preoperative tibiotalar alignment when postoperative alignment is restored to neutral at the time of arthroplasty.

We examined whether gastrocnemius recession would significantly increase dorsiflexion even with a negative Silfverskiöld test.
Data were prospectively collected on a consecutive series of 29 patients who underwent TAR. All were deemed to require lengthening of the posterior soft tissue structures for unacceptable equinus contracture. Once each patient was under anesthesia, Silfverskiöld's test was performed. A digital photograph was taken with the ankle at maximum passive dorsiflexion with the knee at 0 degrees of flexion and again with the knee at 30 degrees of flexion. Strayer gastrocnemius recession was then performed in standard fashion in every patient. After recession, Silfverskiöld's test was again performed with photographs obtained in the same manner. The digital photographs demonstrating the results of the preoperative and postoperative Silfverskiöld's tests in both knee positions were analyzed and the degree of ankle dorsiflexion measured.
Regardless of the results of Silfverskiöld's test, after gastrocnemius recession, patients had an average increase of 12.6 ± 1.6 degrees of dorsiflexion with the knee extended compared to the same position preoperatively (P < .0001) and an increase of 10.1 ± 2.0 degrees with the knee flexed (P < .001). In 6 patients Silfverskiöld's test was markedly positive preoperatively; in this group, recession resulted in an average increase of dorsiflexion of 17.8 ± 3.6 degrees with the knee extended (P = .004) and 13.4 ± 5.4 degrees with the knee flexed (P = .055). For the remaining 23 patients with a negative preoperative Silfverskiöld's test, dorsiflexion increased by 11.3 ± 1.6 (P < .0001) and 9.3 ± 2.2 degrees (P = .0003) with the knee extended and flexed, respectively.

Previous studies exist using vascular injection to visualize the topic [Giebel et al. (Surg Radiol Anat 19:231-235, 1997); Mulfinger and Trueta (J Bone Joint Surg Br 52:160-167, 1970); Peterson et al. (Acta Orthop Scand 46:1026-1034, 1975); Peterson and Goldie (Acta Orthop Scand 45:260-270, 1974)]. The vascularization of the talus has previously been described by various authors [Aquino et al. (J Foot Surg 25:188-193, 1986); Haliburton et al. (J Bone Joint Surg Am 40:1115-1120, 1958); Mulfinger and Trueta (1970); Peterson et al. (1975); Wildenauer (Z Orthop Ihre Grenzgeb 113:730, 1975)]. The plastination method provides excellent intraosseous view of the arterial system and offers a helpful method to demonstrate the influence of the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) on the blood vessels.
In a first step, the nutritive foramina were analyzed on 20 macerated cadaver feet. After this, the articular surface was measured with a print using Optosil. The next step was the visualization of the vascularization of the talus using the plastination method. After vascular injection, a STAR was implanted in two specimens and a plastination was done.
The highest amount and density of nutritive foramina were found in the sulcus tali. Using the imprint technique for the examined tali, we found a mean area covered by cartilage of 56.9% in comparison to the total surface. The deep fin of STAR has the potential to eliminate important blood vessels of the talus.
The plastination methods were useful methods to analyze the arterial supply of the talus. In our study, the STAR showed a dominant influence on the vascularization of the talus. The fin appeared to be too long. A design modification with a short fin could provide the arterial supply, but should be tested biomechanically."|The plastination methods were useful methods to analyze the arterial supply of the talus.

Critical evaluation of the registry data information will benefit the surgeon, patient, and industry. However, the implementation and acceptance of registry data for total ankle replacement has lagged behind that of hip and knee implant arthroplasty. Currently, several countries have national joint arthroplasty registries, with only some procuring information for total ankle replacement. We performed an electronic search to identify publications and worldwide registry databanks with pertinent information specific to total ankle replacement to determine the type of prostheses used and usage trends over time. We identified worldwide registry data from 33 countries, with details pertinent to total ankle replacement identified in only 6 countries. The obtained information was arbitrarily stratified into 3 distinct periods: 2000 to 2006, 2007 to 2010, and 2011. Within these study periods, the data from 13 total ankle replacement systems involving 3,980 ankles were identified. The vast majority (97%) of the reported ankle replacements were 3-component, mobile-bearing, uncemented prostheses. Three usage trends were identified: initial robust embracement followed by abrupt disuse, minimal use, and initial embracement followed by sustained growth in implantation. Before the widespread acceptance of new total ankle replacements, the United States should scrutinize and learn from the international registry data and develop its own national joint registry that would include total ankle replacement. Caution against the adoption of newly released prostheses, especially those without readily available revision components, is recommended. ||||Copyright © 2013 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short to midterm clinical and radiographic outcomes of the Salto fixed bearing total ankle prosthesis.
We retrospectively reviewed the radiographs and patient records of 74 consecutive patients with 75 TAA implants from January 2007 to April 2011. The average age was 60.6 years (range, 41-82) with 41 females and 33 males. The average clinical follow-up was 43 months (range, 24-73 months). Radiographs were reviewed for areas of radiolucency and cystic changes around the talar and tibial implants, as well as for implant migration using standardized tibal, talar, talocalcaneal, and tibial slope angular measurements. The validated Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), Short Form-12 (SF-12), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were used as subjective patient outcome measures. Kaplan Meier (K-M) curves were created for implant survivorship with revision of components as an endpoint and for return to the operating room for any reason.
Total ankle survivorship was 98%. Thirteen patients returned to the operating room for any reason. There was 1 deep infection, and no ankles were converted to an arthrodesis. Average ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion improved from 4.3 ± 3.3 to 8.7 ± 5.6 degrees (P = .0008) and 24 ± 11 to 29 ± 7 degrees (P = .04), respectively. Patients showed significant improvements in all subscales of the FAOS (P < .0001). The physical component of the SF-12 significantly improved from 30 ± 8 to 41 ± 13 (P < .0001), but this was not observed with the mental component (52 ± 1 vs 53 ± 1, P = .55). The mean VAS for patient satisfaction was 9 (range, 2-10). Two patients had component migration (1 tibial and 1 talar component), neither of which required a revision procedure. Six ankles had a total of 9 radiolucent lines with a radiographically stable implant, and no patients had cystic changes.

We used the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration, which uses risk of bias profiling to assess the quality of papers in favour of a domain-based approach. Continuous outcome scores were pooled across studies using the generic inverse variance method and the random-effects model was used to incorporate clinical and methodological heterogeneity. We included 58 papers (7942 TARs) with an interobserver reliability (Kappa) for selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting bias of between 0.83 and 0.98. The overall survivorship was 89% at ten years with an annual failure rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 1.6). The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score changed from 40 (95% CI 36 to 43) pre-operatively to 80 (95% CI 76 to 84) at a mean follow-up of 8.2 years (7 to 10) (p < 0.01). Radiolucencies were identified in up to 23% of TARs after a mean of 4.4 years (2.3 to 9.6). The mean total range of movement improved from 23° (95% CI 19 to 26) to 34° (95% CI 26 to 41) (p = 0.01). Our study demonstrates that TAR has a positive impact on patients' lives, with benefits lasting ten years, as judged by improvement in pain and function, as well as improved gait and increased range of movement. However, the quality of evidence is weak and fraught with biases and high quality randomised controlled trials are required to compare TAR with other forms of treatment such as fusion.|||||10.1302/0301-620X.95B11.31633|2013-10-24|[{'lastname': 'Zaidi', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'UCL Institute of Orthopaedics & Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust, Brockley Hill, Stanmore HA7 4LP, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Cro', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gurusamy', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Siva', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Macgregor', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Henricson', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Goldberg', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]

We report the incidence and characteristics of periprosthetic osteolysis and its association with clinical outcomes after TAA using the HINTEGRA ankle system.
Between May 2004 and April 2010, 126 primary TAA were performed on 115 patients. We excluded 27 ankles with a follow-up of less than 24 months; thus, 99 ankles in 90 patients with a mean follow-up of 40.8 (range, 24-89) months were included in the study. Pain and clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score. Fluoroscopy was used for optimum visualization of the bone-implant interfaces on radiographs. Computed tomography (CT) was conducted on 25 ankles that exhibited progression of osteolysis.
Radiographs revealed that 37 of the 99 ankles showed radiologic evidence of osteolysis; of these, 10 demonstrated continuous progression over the study period. Helical CT scans were more accurate than radiographs for identifying and measuring periprosthetic osteolysis in TAA. None of the demographic parameters were substantially different between the 2 groups of subjects (with or without osteolysis). No major association was found between the presence of osteolysis and clinical and radiologic outcomes.
Osteolysis associated with TAA may indeed be common in the postoperative period. Although most of the osteolytic lesions observed here were relatively quiescent, these lesions raise concerns in contemporary TAA because of their incidence rate and the potential for later mechanical failure as compared to arthrodesis. Early diagnosis and careful evaluation of osteolysis may provide a clinical opportunity for limited revision surgery in ankles of impending prosthesis failure.

The study included 50 cases each of total ankle replacement arthroplasty with the Hintegra and Mobility total ankle systems performed between May 2008 and June 2010. The Mobility group included 24 men and 25 women, and the mean age was 60.3 years (range, 50.7-70.0 years). The Hintegra group included 25 men and 25 women, and the mean age was 59.8 years (range, 50.8-68.7 years). The 2 groups did not differ in terms of gender (P = .76) or age (P = .77). Three independent observers with different levels of training evaluated the radiographs and performed the measurements independently. Each observer evaluated the radiographs twice at a 6-week interval to determine the intraobserver reliability, and the anteroposterior offset ratio was evaluated.
The anteroposterior offset ratio intra- and interobserver reliabilities all showed good or excellent levels of agreement in the Hintegra total ankle system and the Mobility total ankle system.

Thus, new intraoperative means are needed to improve the precision of hindfoot surgery. We therefore sought a hindfoot alignment guide that would be as simple as the alignment guides used in total knee arthroplasty.
A novel hindfoot alignment guide (HA guide) has been developed that projects the mechanical axis from the tibia down to the heel. The HA guide enables the positioning of the hindfoot in the desired varus/valgus position and in plantigrade position in the lateral plane. The HA guide was used intraoperatively from May through November 2011 in 11 complex patients with simultaneous correction of the supramalleolar, tibiotalar, and inframalleolar alignment. Pre- and postoperative Saltzman views were taken and the position was measured.
The HA guide significantly improved the intraoperative positioning compared with visual means: The accuracy with the HA guide was 4.5 ± 5.1 degrees (mean ± standard deviation) and without the HA guide 9.4 ± 5.5 degrees (P < .05). In 7 of 11 patients, the preoperative plan was changed because of the HA guide (2 avoided osteotomies, 5 additional osteotomies).

However, at least 1 system offers intramedullary referencing. In total knee arthroplasty, studies suggest that tibial component placement is more accurate with intramedullary referencing. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of extramedullary referencing with intramedullary referencing for tibial component placement in total ankle arthroplasty.
The coronal and sagittal tibial component alignment was evaluated on the postoperative weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of 236 consecutive fixed-bearing TAAs. Radiographs were measured blindly by 2 investigators. The postoperative alignment of the prosthesis was compared with the surgeon's intended alignment in both planes. The accuracy of tibial component alignment was compared between the extramedullary and intramedullary referencing techniques using unpaired t tests. Interrater and intrarater reliabilities were assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).
Eighty-three tibial components placed with an extramedullary referencing technique were compared with 153 implants placed with an intramedullary referencing technique. The accuracy of the extramedullary referencing was within a mean of 1.5 ± 1.4 degrees and 4.1 ± 2.9 degrees in the coronal and sagittal planes, respectively. The accuracy of intramedullary referencing was within a mean of 1.4 ± 1.1 degrees and 2.5 ± 1.8 degrees in the coronal and sagittal planes, respectively.

Multiple surgical options range from joint sparing procedures for the younger patient to total ankle replacement for the older, less active patient. Arthrodesis remains the gold standard and is the procedure of choice for younger patients who are heavy laborers and in patients with severe arthritis who are not candidates for a total ankle replacement. Joint sparing operations include allograft resurfacing, arthroscopic debridement and osteophyte resection, joint distraction arthroplasty, and supramalleolar osteotomy. In older low demand patients, the surgeon may consider a total ankle arthroplasty as an alternative to arthrodesis. ||||||2013-09-17|[{'lastname': 'Weatherall', 'firstname': 'Justin M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mroczek', 'firstname': 'Kenneth', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McLaurin', 'firstname': 'Toni', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ding', 'firstname': 'Bryan', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tejwani', 'firstname': 'Nirmal', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]

Thirty consecutive patients (21 females, nine males; mean age, 64.8 years) underwent INBONE total ankle arthroplasty during 2007-2011. After IRB approval, a retrospective pre- and post-operative radiographic analysis was performed using validated linear and angular measurements. The pre- and post-operative assessment included the tibial angle, talar angle, tibial slope, and coronal deformity. Post-operative measurements also included the talocalcaneal angle, joint space height, talar height, lateral tibial component angle, lateral talar component angle, and anteroposterior tibial component angle. The post-operative bone loss, subluxation, positioning, and subsidence were also assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using two-sample t test and Fisher's exact test.
Out of 30 patients, 23 had a successful clinical outcome with intact prosthesis at a 2-year follow-up. The only variables with significant correlation (p < 0.05) to the post-surgical outcome were the lateral talar component angle (p = 0.002) and the mean difference between pre- and post-operative tibial slope (p = 0.001). The coronal deformity had significant mean difference between pre- and post-operative values (p < 0.001); however, it lacked a significant correlation to the final surgical outcome. None of the categorical variables had a significant correlation with post-surgical outcome.

Total ankle arthroplasty has become an increasingly popular treatment for patients with symptomatic ankle osteoarthritis. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty for osteoarthritis with preoperative sagittal malalignment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of anterior translation of the talus on outcomes of three-component total ankle arthroplasty.
One hundred and four osteoarthritic ankles in 104 patients who underwent three-component total ankle arthroplasty were included in this study. The 104 ankles were divided into 2 groups: ankles with anteriorly translated talus (50 ankles), and ankles with non-translated talus (54 ankles). Clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed in both groups. The mean follow-up duration was 42.8 ± 17.9 months (range, 24 to 95 months).
Forty-six (92%) of 50 ankles with anterior translation of the talus showed relocation of the talus within the mortise at 6 months, and 48 (96%) ankles were relocated at 12 months after total ankle arthroplasty. But, 2 (4%) ankles were not relocated until the final follow-up. The AOFAS scores, ankle range of motion, and radiographic outcomes showed no significant difference between the two groups at the final follow-up (p > 0.05 for each).
In majority of cases, the anteriorly translated talus in osteoarthritic ankles was restored to an anatomical position within 6 months after successful three-component total ankle arthroplasty.

The annual figures for primary ankle joint arthrodeses and total ankle replacements performed in patients with RA were obtained from nationwide population-based registries. Incidences were calculated per population of 10(5) and they are reported in 2-year periods.
During the study period, 593 primary ankle joint arthrodeses and 318 total ankle arthroplasties were performed in patients with RA.

A 22 case series.|['Histology', 'Periprosthetic osteolysis', 'Total ankle arthroplasty']|Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR|"Medium-term results for total ankle replacement (TAR) are in general satisfactory, but there is a high redo rate for periprosthetic osteolysis associated with the AES implant.
Comparing radioclinical findings and histologic analysis of implant revision procedure specimens can account for the elevated rate of osteolysis associated with the AES TAR implant.
In a prospective series of 84 AES TAR implants (2003-2008), 25 underwent revision for osteolysis (including three undergoing revision twice) at a mean 59.8 months. Eight patients had hydroxyapatite (HA) coated models and the others had titanium-hydroxyapatite (Ti-HA) coatings. Radiographs were systematically analyzed on Besse's protocol and evolution was monitored on AOFAS scores. The 94 specimens taken for histologic analysis during revision were re-examined, focusing specifically on foreign bodies.
Macroscopically, no metallosis or polyethylene wear was found at revision. AOFAS global and pain scores fell respectively from 89.7/100 at 1 year postoperatively to 72.9 before revision and from 32.5/40 to 20.6/40, although global scores were unchanged in 25% of patients. Radiologically, all patients showed tibial and talar osteolytic lesions, 45% showed cortical lysis and in 25% the implant had collapsed into the cysts. All specimens showed macrophagic granulomatous inflammatory reactions in contact with a foreign body; the cysts showed necrotic remodeling. Some of the foreign bodies could be identified on optical histologic examination with polyethylene in 95% of the specimens and metal in 60% (100% of HA-coated models and 33.3% of Ti-HA-coated models). Unidentifiable material was associated: a brownish pigment in Ti-HA-coated models (33.3%) and flakey bodies in 44.4% of the HA-coated models and 18.2% of the Ti-HA-coated models.
The phenomenon of periprosthetic osteolysis is still poorly understood, although implant wear debris seems to be implicated. All the patients with HA-coated implants with modular tibial stem had metal particles in the tissue around the implant, although their exact nature could not be determined. The double-layer Ti-HA coating may induce delamination by fretting while the biological bone anchorage is forming.

Fifty-eight fresh frozen Chinese cadaveric ankle specimens, 26 females, and 32 males, were CT-scanned in the neutral position and their 3D computer graphics-based models were reconstructed. The 3D morphology of the distal tibia/fibula segment and the full talus was analyzed by measuring 31 parameters, defining the relevant dimensions, areas, and volumes from the models. The measurements were compared statistically between sexes and with previously reported data from Caucasian subjects. The results showed that, within a general similarity of ankle morphology between the current Chinese and previous Caucasian subjects groups, there were significant differences in 9 out of the 31 parameters analyzed. From a quantitative comparison with available prostheses designed for the Caucasian population, few of these designs have both tibial and talar components suitable in dimension for the Chinese population.

American volume|"Preoperative talar varus deformity increases the technical difficulty of total ankle replacement and is associated with an increased failure rate. Deformity of >20° has been reported to be a contraindication to arthroplasty. We determined whether clinical outcomes of total ankle replacement in patients with ankle arthritis and preoperative talar varus deformity of ≥10° were comparable with those of patients with varus deformity of <10°.
Thirty-six ankles with preoperative coronal-plane tibiotalar varus deformity of ≥10° (""varus"" group) and thirty-six prospectively matched ankles with varus deformity of <10° (""neutral"" group) underwent total ankle replacement. Preoperative and postoperative evaluations included AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society) ankle-hindfoot scores, Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) scores, Short Form (SF)-36 scores, and radiographic measurements of coronal-plane deformity.
The cohorts were similar with respect to age, sex, operatively treated side, body mass index, and components used, and the mean duration of clinical follow-up was 34.7 months. Eighteen (50%) of the ankles in the varus group had a preoperative varus deformity of ≥20°. Patients in the varus group underwent more ancillary procedures during the index surgery to achieve a plantigrade foot. The AOFAS score improved by a mean of 57.2 points in the varus group and 51.5 points in the neutral group. The AOS pain and disability component scores decreased significantly in both groups. The improvement in AOS and SF-36 scores did not differ significantly between the groups at the time of the final follow-up. Tibiotalar deformity improved significantly toward a normal weight-bearing axis in the varus group. Thirteen ankles in the varus group and six in the neutral group underwent additional procedures at a later date.
Satisfactory results can be achieved in patients with varus malalignment of ≥10°, which should not be considered a contraindication to total ankle replacement. Complication rates can be reduced by utilizing meticulous surgical technique and taking care to address all causes of the varus deformity, particularly through osteophyte debridement, correction of cavus deformity, and soft-tissue balancing.

The protocol consisted of scanning at 100, 120, and 140 kVp in every position with a pitch of 1.2. The scanning at 120 kVp in every position was repeated with a pitch of 1.0.
CT proved to be a reliable imaging modality when studying periprosthetic lesions adjacent to the ankle prosthesis when the tibial stem alignment was parallel to the table.

There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the mean AOFAS score, visual analogue score for pain or range of movement of the ankle at the latest follow-up. Most radiological measurements did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, the most common grade of heterotopic ossification (HO) was grade 3 in the HINTEGRA group (10 of 13 TARs, 76.9%) and grade 2 in the Mobility group (four of seven TARs, 57.1%) (p = 0.025). Although HO was more frequent in the HINTEGRA group (40.6%) than in the Mobility group (20.0%), this was not statistically significant (p = 0.065).The difference in peri-operative complications between the two groups was not significant, but intra-operative medial malleolar fractures occurred in four (11.4%) in the Mobility group; four (12.5%) in the HINTEGRA group and one TAR (2.9%) in the Mobility group failed (p = 0.185).|||||10.1302/0301-620X.95B8.31774|2013-08-03|[{'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'G W', 'initials': 'GW', 'affiliation': 'Veterans Health Service Medical Center, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, 61 Jinhwangdoro-gil, Gangdong-gu, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'H J', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yeo', 'firstname': 'E D', 'initials': 'ED', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'S Y', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': None}]

Despite its widespread use, the KLGS has never been validated for use in this clinical circumstance. The purpose of this study was to determine the inter- and intrarater reliability of the KLGS in the assessment of radiographic progression of OA in the peritalar joints following total ankle replacement (TAR).
One hundred twenty pre- and minimum 5-year postoperative weight-bearing lateral radiographs following 60 consecutive cases of TAR were utilized. Each individual film was considered separately for the purposes of this study. Of those films, 93 and 98 were found to have adequate visualization of the subtalar (STJ) and talonavicular (TNJ) joints, respectively. Three qualified reviewers graded the films according to the KLGS on 2 separate occasions, with 1 month separating the 2 readings. The results were analyzed for intra- and interobserver reliability. The degree of agreement was analyzed using the weighted kappa (κ(w)) statistic, Fleiss's kappa (Fleiss's κ), and percentage agreement
Interrater agreements were moderate (κ(w) = 0.37 ± 0.06; Fleiss's κ = 0.21 ± 0.03) for the STJ to fair (κ(w) = 0.43 ± 0.06; Fleiss's κ = 0.25 ± 0.03) for the TNJ. Intrarater agreements for the STJ were moderate (mean κ(w) = 0.43 ± 0.07) and moderate for the TNJ as well (mean κ(w) = 0.46 ± 0.07). The reliability of the KLGS, although not originally designed for use in the setting of inflammatory arthropathy, was not notably affected when being used to grade inflammatory versus noninflammatory arthropathy.
The KLGS is likely not a reliable tool for grading the degree of OA present in the peritalar joints prior to treatment and following TAR for research purposes. Using the KLGS in the setting of inflammatory arthritis versus OA did not produce any notable differences in the observed reliability. It is important to remember this has not been assessed in the clinical environment. Further work is required to determine the optimal method for assessment of peritalar OA.

Total ankle arthroplasty imposes special requirements on the methodology of data collection, evaluation, publication and the assessment of register data.
We undertook a structured and descriptive analysis of all outcome data available from high-quality national arthroplasty registers worldwide. Register data from Sweden, Finland, Norway, New Zealand and Australia were included in the analysis.
There are marked differences between Europe and Oceania with respect to indications. All data sets show revision rates of approximately 10 % at five years, of which about 40 % of cases are for aseptic loosening. Inlay fractures are relatively common, which indicates potential for the improvement of implants. The documentation of intraoperative surgical errors leading to revision surgery varies significantly among registers. A relevant number of complications are treated without an implant component being exchanged and therefore not covered by a register.
The results of TAA are promising, but the revision rate is higher than for total hip or knee arthroplasty. TAA outcome measurement by means of registers has several specific requirements necessitating additional documentation beyond the basic data set. For methodological reasons the evaluation of results is more complex than for hip or knee arthroplasty. It will therefore be essential to standardise data collection and evaluation and develop a methodology addressing the specific needs of TAA."|||There are marked differences between Europe and Oceania with respect to indications.

Twenty-one patients with severe ankle arthritis who underwent unilateral total ankle arthroplasty using a 2-component Salto Talaris device with a fixed polyethylene bearing were studied prospectively. Mean age was 69 years in 16 female and 5 male patients, and mean follow-up was 37.2 (range, 24-50) months. Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed using a 12-camera digital-motion capture system preoperatively and repeated at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. Temporospatial measurements included velocity, cadence, step length, and support times. Measured kinematic parameters included sagittal plane range of motion of the ankle, knee, and hip. Kinetic parameters included sagittal plane ankle power and ankle plantarflexion moment.
There was significant improvement in temporospatial parameters, including step length (P = .014) and walking velocity, which increased from 0.9 to 1 m/s (P = .01). Kinematic results showed sagittal plane range of motion of the ankle increased significantly from a mean of 15.8 degrees preoperatively to 20.6 degrees (P = .00005) postoperatively with the increase occurring primarily in dorsiflexion.

The literature also demonstrates a learning curve among surgeons adopting TAA. The purpose of this study is to better define this learning curve for surgeons using third-generation implants.
Charts and radiographs were reviewed for the initial 26 TAA procedures performed by the senior author. Three third-generation implants were used: SBi (Small Bone Innovations) STAR, Salto Talaris, and Wright Medical INBONE. We report perioperative and early postoperative complications.
Two perioperative fractures occurred in the first 9 cases, and the incidence subsequently dropped to 0 (P = .0431). Two cases of component malalignment occurred in the first 3 patients receiving the STAR implant, and the incidence then dropped to 0 (P = .0034). Five wound complications (4 minor and 1 major) occurred, all in the final 14 patients. No cases of nerve injury, tendon laceration, or deep vein thrombosis occurred. Two patients returned to the operating room as a result of complications, and the total perioperative and early postoperative complication rate was 27%.
The observed rate of perioperative and early postoperative complications in this case series was low relative to other similar-sized studies, suggesting that third-generation implants can reduce adverse events.

We report on the early clinical results of the largest known cohort of patients in the United States who received a Salto Talaris total ankle replacement for the treatment of end-stage arthritis of the ankle.
We prospectively followed sixty-seven patients with a minimum clinical follow-up of two years. Patients completed standardized assessments and underwent physical examination, functional assessment, and radiographic evaluation preoperatively and at six weeks, three months, and six months postoperatively and yearly thereafter through their most recent follow-up.
Implant survival at a mean follow-up time of 2.8 years was 96% when metallic component revision, removal, or impending failure was used as the end point. Three patients developed aseptic loosening, and all instances involved the tibial component. One of the three patients underwent revision to another fixed-bearing total ankle arthroplasty system, one patient is awaiting revision surgery, and the third patient has remained minimally symptomatic and fully functional without additional surgery. Forty-five patients underwent at least one additional procedure at the time of the index surgery. The most common concurrent procedure performed was a deltoid ligament release (n = 21). Eight patients underwent additional surgery following the index arthroplasty, most commonly debridement for medial and/or lateral impingement (n = 4). As of the most recent follow-up, patients demonstrated significant improvement in pain scores, American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot score, and functional scores.

The purpose of this study was to compare trends and demographics in the performance of ankle fusion and total ankle replacement in the United States.
The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes of patients undergoing ankle fusion and total ankle replacement were searched using the PearlDiver Patient Record Database, a national database of orthopaedic patients. The CPT codes for open ankle arthrodesis (27870), arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis (29899), and total ankle replacement (27700, 27702) were searched for the years 2004 to 2009 to identify relative changes in the performance of ankle fusion and replacement over time.
The performance of ankle fusion was unchanged during the 6-year study period. In contrast, an increase in total ankle replacement was observed, from 0.63 cases per 10 000 patients searched in 2004 to 0.99 cases per 10 000 patients in 2009 (P < .05). Both ankle fusion and total ankle replacement were performed most commonly in patients aged 60 to 69 years (P < .05).

Until recently, it has not been possible to quantify or even objectively demonstrate biomechanical findings to substantiate the theory that postsurgical biomechanical changes in the ankle produce changes in the kinematics of the hindfoot. Standard gait analysis has treated the foot as a single biomechanical unit. This study was undertaken to describe the hindfoot motion following Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) TAA by using multisegment foot model gait analysis.
Forty-six patients with a mean age of 66 years underwent a 3D gait analysis following TAR. Mean interval between surgery and gait analysis was 4.9 years (range 2 to 9). The contralateral limb was used as control for each patient. Temporospatial variables and kinematic parameters were studied.
Temporospatial results showed statistically significant differences. Stance time on the affected side was 61.1% ± 2.2% of the gait cycle compared to 63.2% ± 2.1% for the unaffected side. Step length was 55.6 cm ± 10 on the affected side compared to 53.9 cm ± 10 for the unaffected side. Kinematics results were statistically significant: Ankle range of motion (ROM) on the arthroplasty side was 16.8 ± 4.5 degrees compared to 23.6 ± 5.0 on the unaffected side. Sagittal plane ROM was 12.7 ± 4.2 degrees on the arthroplasty side and 17.3 ± 3.5 degrees on the unaffected side. Coronal plane ROM was 4.7 ± 2.4 degrees on the arthroplasty side and 7.5 ± 2.4 degrees on the unaffected side. Transverse plane ROM on the arthroplasty side was 4.1 ± 1.5 degrees and 4.9 ± 1.6 on the unaffected side.
This study showed that, in addition to previously documented diminution in sagittal plane motion and gait velocity, some of the residual abnormalities of gait following TAR were comprised of differences in hindfoot function. These results relate to the growing recognition of the importance of understanding hindfoot mechanics apart from those of the tibiotalar joint.

The aim of this study was to objectively compare gait differences of patients after unilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) with a group of healthy controls.
A total of 26 TAA, 26 TKA and 26 THA patients with a mean (± SD) age of 64 (± 9) years were evaluated six months after surgery and compared with 26 matched healthy controls. Subjects were asked to walk at self-selected normal and fast speeds on a validated pressure mat. The following spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured: walking velocity, cadence, single-limb support (SLS) time, double-limb support (DLS) time, stance time, step length and step width.
TAA and TKA patients walked slower than controls at normal (p<0.05) and fast speeds (p<0.01). The involved side of TAA and TKA patients showed shorter SLS compared to controls at both normal and fast speeds (p<0.01). Regardless of walking speed, the uninvolved side of TAA and TKA patients demonstrated longer stance time and shorter step length than controls (p<0.01). TAA patients showed shorter SLS of the involved side, longer stance time and shorter step length of the uninvolved side compared to the contralateral side at both normal and fast speeds (p<0.001).
Gait disability after unilateral lower-limb joint arthroplasty was more marked for distal than for proximal joints at six months after surgery, with a proximal-to-distal progression in the impairment (TAA>TKA>THA). THA patients demonstrated no gait differences compared with controls. In contrast, TAA and TKA patients still demonstrated gait differences compared to controls, with slower walking velocity and reduced SLS in the involved limb.

American journal of roentgenology|"Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is becoming a popular alternative to arthrodesis for patients with end-stage ankle arthrosis. Prior outcome studies have primarily focused on surgical findings. Our purpose is to determine the radiographic outcome of TAA and to correlate it with clinical outcome.
In a 9-year retrospective review of patients with TAA, all available ankle radiographs and clinical data were reviewed. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Fisher exact test, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves for radiographic and clinical survival.
Two hundred sixty-two TAAs in 260 patients were reviewed; 55% were in women, and the mean patient age was 61.5 years. The mean radiographic follow-up was 142 weeks, with an average of six radiographs per patient. One hundred sixty-three patients (62.2% of TAAs) developed one or more radiographic complications, including periprosthetic lucency (34.0%), hardware subsidence (24.4%), perihardware fracture (11.1%), syndesmotic screw loosening (10.3%), and screw fracture (6.5%). One hundred nineteen patients (45.4% of TAAs) developed symptoms of ankle pain or instability, and 71 patients (27.1% of TAAs) underwent at least one reoperation. In patients with radiographic complications, 41.7% developed ankle pain and 5.1% developed ankle instability, compared with 23.7% and 2.2%, respectively, of patients with no radiologic complications (p < 0.05). Of the patients with radiographic complications, 33.1% had at least one additional surgery compared with 17.1% of patients without radiographic complications (p < 0.05).

However, there are very limited data prospectively evaluating the effects on gait after ankle arthroplasty compared with ankle arthrodesis. Controversy remains regarding the relative advantages and disadvantages of these 2 treatments and especially the differences in function between them.
We performed a prospective study involving 28 patients with posttraumatic and primary ankle osteoarthritis and a control group of 14 normal volunteers. We compared gait in 14 patients who had undergone ankle arthrodesis with the gait of 14 patients who had ankle arthroplasty preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively. Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed with a 12-camera digital-motion capture system. Temporospatial measurements included stride length and cadence. The kinematic parameters that were measured included the sagittal plane range of motion of the ankle and the coronal plane range of motion of the ankle. Double force plates were used to collect kinetic parameters such as ankle coronal and plantar flexion-dorsiflexion moments and sagittal plane ankle power. Center of pressure (CoP) and its progression in gait cycle were calculated.
Baseline parameters showed comparability among the treatment and control groups. Temporospatial analysis, using time as the main effect, showed that compared with ankle arthrodesis, patients with total ankle arthroplasty had higher walking velocity attributable to both increases in stride length and cadence as well as more normalized first and second rockers of the gait cycle. Kinematic analysis, using time and intervention as the main effects, showed that patients who had ankle arthroplasty had better sagittal dorsiflexion (P = .001), whereas those undergoing ankle arthrodesis had better coronal plane eversion (P = .01). Neither ankle arthrodesis nor arthroplasty altered the CoP progression during stance phase. Total ankle arthroplasty produced a more symmetrical vertical ground reaction force curve, which was closer to that of the controls than was the curve of the ankle arthrodesis group.
Patients in both the arthrodesis and arthroplasty groups had significant improvements in various parameters of gait when compared with their own preoperative function. Neither group functioned as well as the normal control subjects. Neither group was superior in every parameter of gait at 1 year postoperatively. However, the data suggest that the major parameters of gait after ankle arthrodesis in deformed ankle arthritis are comparable to gait function after total ankle arthroplasty in nondeformed ankle arthritis.

A treatment-oriented classification of these fractures has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, cause, and location of periprosthetic fractures and the stability of the associated prosthetic components after total ankle replacement and to develop a method of classification.
Data regarding 503 total ankle replacements with a mean follow-up of 14.7 months were reviewed. The prevalence, location, and possible cause of the fractures as well as prosthesis stability were analyzed and a systematic method of classification based on these factors was developed.
Twenty-one patients (4.2%) with a periprosthetic fracture were identified. The fracture was intraoperative (Type 1) in eleven patients (2.2%) and postoperative in the remaining ten (2.0%). Two of the latter fractures were traumatic (Type 2) and eight were stress fractures (Type 3). Two-thirds (fourteen) of the twenty-one fractures occurred in the medial malleolus.
The prevalence of periprosthetic fractures following primary total ankle replacement was relatively low. We propose a classification system for these fractures that is based on more than 500 cases.

11 young adults with unilateral transtibial amputation participated in two data collection sessions spaced approximately 3 weeks apart. In each session they walked across a loose rock surface at three controlled speeds. In the first session, they wore a passive, energy storage and return prosthesis and in the second, they wore a powered prosthesis (BiOM, iWalk, Bedford, MA, USA).
Subjects had a 10% faster self-selected walking speed when wearing the powered (1.16 m/s) compared to unpowered prosthesis (1.05 m/s; p=0.031). They walked with increased ankle plantarflexion on their prosthetic limb throughout the gait cycle when wearing the powered compared to unpowered prosthesis. This was especially evident in the increased plantarflexion during push-off (p<0.001). There was a small (<3°), but statistically significant decrease in knee flexion during early stance when wearing the powered device (p=0.045). Otherwise, the kinematics of the knee and hip were nearly identical when wearing the different devices. Subjects had decreased medial-lateral motion of their center of mass when wearing the powered prosthesis (p=0.020), but there were no differences in medial-lateral margins of stability between the devices (p=0.662).

We analyzed the interface between the tibial bone and tibial component with a thermoelastic stress analysis to demonstrate load transmission onto the distal tibia. In this regard, we used two established ankle prostheses, which were implanted in two human cadaveric and in two third-generation composite tibia bones (Sawbones®, Sweden). Subsequently, the bones were attached to a hydropulser and a sinusoidal load of 700 N was applied.
Both prostheses had an inhomogeneous load transmission onto the distal tibia. Instead of distributing load equally to the subarticular bone, forces were focused around the bolting stem, accumulating as stress maxima with forces up to 90 MPa. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate load transmission into the metaphysis of the bone.
As demonstrated in this study, anchoring systems with stems used in all established total ankle prostheses lead to an inhomogeneous load transmission onto the distal tibia, and furthermore, to a distribution of load into the weaker metaphyseal bone. For these reasons, we favor a prosthetic design with minimal bone resection and without any stem or stem-like anchoring system, which facilitates a homogeneous load transmission onto the distal tibia.

The average duration of follow-up for the patients without revision was 12.4 years (range, 10.8 to 14.9 years). Sixty-two of the seventy-seven ankles were available for final follow-up.
Twenty-nine (38%) of the seventy-seven ankles had a revision of at least one of the metallic components. The probability of implant survival was 70.7% at ten years and 45.6% at fourteen years. The main reasons for revision were aseptic loosening, subsidence of the talar component, and progressive cyst formation. Polyethylene insert fractures were observed in eleven ankles.
While the midterm to short-term results for patients managed with the STAR prosthesis have been encouraging at 3.7 years, the long-term survivorship of the same cohort was considerably inferior. The subjective and clinical results of the patients with retained prostheses are generally good and comparable with results reported in the current literature."|||Twenty-nine (38%) of the seventy-seven ankles had a revision of at least one of the metallic components.

Currently, loosening is defined by morphologic changes in osseous architecture determined by plain radiography. The loss of bone noted at diagnosis presents difficulties in future ankle revisions. A method by which early aseptic loosening could be detected before bony deformation or reaction could lead to improved patient outcomes. A cadaveric fresh frozen ankle specimen (mid-tibia to include the foot) was used in the present study. An anterior approach to the ankle was performed. A total ankle prosthesis was implanted in the standard fashion (Salto Talaris, Tornier). The initial cuts were made for a size 1 ankle, and a size 1 ankle was implanted. Dynamic ultrasonography was used to evaluate the bone-implant interface. The prosthesis was removed, and sequential removal of bone was performed at the interface of the medial tibial tray until visible motion was seen with flexion and extension. The reimplanted prosthesis was then re-evaluated using dynamic ultrasonography and dynamic and static fluoroscopy. In the loose prosthesis model, dynamic ultrasonography was able to determine the motion at the bone-prosthesis interface. Dynamic ultrasonography might be a useful tool in the evaluation of early loosening in a total ankle arthroplasty model.||||Copyright © 2013 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

786|23522738|Relationship of alignment and tibial cortical coverage to hypertrophic bone formation in Salto Talaris® total ankle arthroplasty.|[]|The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons|A retrospective analysis of 107 Salto Talaris(®) total ankle replacements was performed to determine the effect of alignment and tibial cortical coverage on the formation of heterotopic bone. The radiographic parameters were studied for at least 18 months to detect any changes over time. The angle of insertion of the implant was most often in varus and with a positive anterior slope. A slight increase was seen in the slope over time (p < .0001) but was not clinically relevant. The mean percentage of cortical coverage of the tibial component was 89%, and only 7 patients had complete coverage of both the anterior and the posterior cortices. The percentage of patients who had hypertrophic bone growth increased over time (p < .0001). As the slope of the implant increased, there was a negative correlation with the degree of tibial coverage (p = .007). There was also an increase in the extent of hypertrophic bone as the tibial coverage decreased. None of the patients had symptoms that required an additional surgical procedure. The results of the present study indicate a high incidence of hypertrophic bone proliferation when the dimensions of the tibial component do not match the anteroposterior depth of the tibia at the plane of resection. Despite the high occurrence rate, the clinical relevance of hypertrophic bone is obscure.||||Copyright © 2013 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the incidence and origin of impingement have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the outcome of patients following gutter debridement has not been reported.
A review of 489 total ankle replacements was performed to calculate the incidence of symptomatic gutter impingement in 4 different devices and between the presenting causes of arthritis. The incidence of gutter impingement was determined for patients with and without preemptive gutter resection at the time of implantation. The functional outcome of 30 of the 34 patients who had subsequent gutter debridement was determined with 3 different outcome instruments.
Symptomatic gutter disease occurred in 34 of 489 cases (7%) followed for a minimum of 1 year (range, 1-12 years). There was a 2% incidence of gutter disease in the 194 ankles that had prophylactic gutter resection at the time of implantation and a 7% incidence in the 295 ankles that did not have gutter resection at the time of implantation. When the ankle treated with an Agility (DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc, Warsaw, IN) device was excluded, there was a 2% and an 18% incidence of gutter disease in the 2 groups, respectively (P < .05). There was no difference in the incidence of gutter disease between the various implants and origins of ankle arthritis. Postoperative outcomes were favorable in the 27 patients who did not have another procedure after the initial gutter debridement. Seven patients (21%) required reoperation.
Prophylactic gutter resection should be considered at the time of implantation to reduce the incidence of postoperative symptoms. Although most patients had favorable outcomes following gutter debridement, there was a high reoperation rate.

This study was undertaken to more accurately address patient expectations, guide postoperative rehabilitation, and improve our understanding of how ankle range of motion changes with time.
119 total ankle replacements of 3 different prosthetic designs from 1 surgeon were retrospectively examined and compared. Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion ranges of motion were calculated and analyzed preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The different ankle replacement systems were analyzed individually and together to determine whether trends were replicated.
No significant increase in ankle range of motion was found 6 months postoperatively (P = .75). Mean combined postoperative range of motion did not change significantly from 24.3 degrees at 1 year versus a preoperative mean of 22.7 degrees (P = .75). Mean dorsiflexion improved significantly at the 6-week postoperative stage by 5.5 degrees (P < .001), whereas plantar flexion only improved by 2.9 degrees (P = .06). Mean dorsiflexion improved from preoperative levels by 5.4 degrees (P = .001), whereas mean plantar flexion decreased by 3.7 degrees (P = .004).
We found no notable improvement in ankle range of motion after 6 months following total ankle arthroplasty. We also found a disproportionately higher increase in dorsiflexion compared with plantar flexion following surgery and an overall reduction in mean plantar flexion range compared with preoperative values. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, total mean ankle range of motion 1 year postoperatively was similar to preoperative values. Reasons for the discrepancy between dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are unclear.

Arthroscopic debridement was performed in selected cases and the clinical outcome was analysed. Among 120 uncomplicated TARs, there was persistent pain with a mean visual analogue scale (VAS) of 2.7 (0 to 8). The intensity of pain decreased in 115 ankles (95.8%). Exercise or walking for more than 30 minutes was the most common aggravating factor (62 ankles, 68.1%). The character of the pain was most commonly described as dull (50 ankles, 54.9%) and located on the medial aspect of the joint (43 ankles, 47.3%). A total of seven ankles (5.8%) underwent subsequent arthroscopy. These patients had local symptoms and a VAS for pain ≥ 7 on exertion. Impingement with fibrosis and synovitis was confirmed. After debridement, the median VAS decreased from 7 to 3 and six patients were satisfied. The median VAS for pain and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score of the ankles after debridement was similar to that of the uncomplicated TARs (p = 0.496 and p = 0.066, respectively). Although TAR reduces the intensity of pain, residual pain is not infrequent even in otherwise uncomplicated TARs and soft-tissue impingement is the possible cause.|||||10.1302/0301-620X.95B3.31219|2013-03-02|[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'B S', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': 'Inha University Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, 7-206, 3-ga, Sinheung-dong, Jung-gu, Incheon 400-711, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'W J', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'J W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': None}]

This study reports the early results of a prospective multicenter study of the Mobility prosthesis.
Eighty-eight Mobility total ankle arthroplasties (TAAs) were implanted in 85 patients. The most common underlying diagnosis was posttraumatic arthritis (53%). Ankles were classified according to the Canadian Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (COFAS) end-stage ankle arthritis classification system. Coronal plane deformity was quantified preoperatively. Patients were reviewed at regular intervals postoperatively, with clinical and radiographic assessment. The mean follow-up time was 40 months (range, 30-60 months).
Type 1 ankle arthritis was demonstrated in 44 ankles (50%). No patient had preoperative coronal plane angulation greater than 20 degrees. In 32 ankles (36%) the preoperative coronal alignment was neutral, and in 34 ankles (39%) the deformity was less than 10 degrees. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot score improved from 38.2 (range, 12-59) preoperatively to 74.8 (range, 46-100) postoperatively. Bone-implant interface abnormalities were identified in 33 ankles with a retained prostheses (43%). Thirty (91%) of these involved zones around the tibial plate. In total, 8 TAAs required revision, 6 for aseptic loosening, 1 for talar migration, and 1 for deep infection. There was 1 conversion to arthrodesis for component malpositioning and 1 transtibial amputation for chronic regional pain syndrome. Six patients were being investigated for ongoing pain. The cumulative survival was 89.6% (95% confidence interval, 80.8-94.8) at 3 years and 88.4% (95% confidence interval, 79.3-93.9) at 4 years.

The purpose of this study was to determine the perioperative complications associated with the Mobility Total Ankle System and whether a learning curve exists for this system.
We recruited 60 consecutive patients undergoing total ankle arthroplasty using the Mobility Total Ankle System for advanced osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis between May 2008 and June 2010. Group A included the initial 30 patients who underwent surgery, and group B included the next 30 patients. Reporting of adverse perioperative events, including wound healing problems, fracture, aseptic loosening, tendinitis, component malposition, neuroma, and bony impingement, was limited to the first 3 months after the surgery.
Eleven of the 30 patients in group A developed complications (36.7%), and 1 died of an unknown cause 6 months after leaving the hospital. The complications in this group included medial malleolar fracture in 6 patients, lateral malleolar fracture in 1, wound healing problems in 2, and varus deformity in 2. Five of the 30 patients in group B developed complications (16.7%). The complications in this group included medial malleolar fracture in 1 patient, medial impingement in 2, Achilles tendon rupture in 1, and wound problems in 1. There was no statistically significant difference (P = .08) between the 2 groups in the incidence of complications after total ankle replacement arthroplasty. There was also no significant difference between the 2 groups in the types of complications seen.
Perioperative complications associated with total ankle replacement arthroplasty using the Mobility Total Ankle System were seen in 16 of 60 patients. Group A had a higher incidence of perioperative complications than did group B. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Either the expertise of the surgeon or the simplicity of the total ankle system can affect the learning curve, although these things were not specifically quantified in this study.

Follow-up studies of total hip arthroplasties show that measurements of periprosthetic osteolytic lesions on radiographs underestimate the size compared with those made on computed tomography (CT), and some of the lesions may even remain undetected on radiographs. However, it is unclear whether the same applies to total ankle arthroplasty (TAA).
We retrospectively reviewed the radiographs of 123 patients who had undergone TAA with the Ankle Evolutive System (AES) implant. Of these, 43 (34.9%) had at least 1 large (greater than 10 mm) osteolytic lesion on radiographs at a minimum follow-up of 14 months (mean, 43.1 months; range, 14-85 months). Forty of the 43 patients underwent helical CT imaging.
Computed tomography showed more osteolytic lesions than radiographs around both tibial and talar components. CT also showed larger lesions than radiographs in 9 of 10 zones around prosthetic components. The difference was highly significant in 3 zones around the talar component.
Computed tomography showed more and larger periprosthetic lesions than radiographs around an ankle prosthesis. Because osteolysis is progressive in nature, it presumably leads to component failure. Considering our results, we recommend adding CT imaging to postoperative follow-up after TAA for patients with suspected or known periprosthetic lucencies on radiographs.

This study aimed to compare the disruption to the arterial supply of the talus between the single-medial-incision approach and the 2-incision approach.
The 2 approaches for triple arthrodesis were compared by analyzing the disruption of arterial vasculature in 14 cadaveric specimens in randomized fashion. The arterial disruption was determined using CT angiography before and after surgery combined with analysis from dissection. The area of joint preparation from each technique was also analyzed and compared.
The single-medial-incision approach caused a high incidence of damage to the deltoid artery (6 of 7 specimens, 86%) and the artery of the tarsal canal (7 of 7 specimens, 100%). The 2-incision approach resulted in damage to the artery of the tarsal sinus in all specimens (7 of 7 specimens, 100%), but the medial vasculature was spared given the limited dissection required to access the talonavicular joint. Through the single-medial-incision approach the percentage of debridement of the calcaneocuboid joint (36%) was significantly lower than the debridement using the 2-incision approach (85%, P < .01). There was no significant difference in joint preparation of the talonavicular and subtalar joints between the 2 approaches with the number of specimens available.
From this cadaveric study, we found that both approaches could result in substantial disruption of the main blood supply to the talus. The single-medial-incision approach consistently disrupted the majority of blood supply to the talar body, while the 2-incision approach caused various degrees of vascular disruption to the talar head and neck. Using the single-medial-incision approach, the calcaneocuboid joint did not show adequate removal of articular cartilage due to difficulty accessing the joint surfaces.
Vascular sparing to the talus should be considered when selecting an appropriate operative approach for triple arthrodesis. Although the clinical significance of this cadaveric study is limited, the 2-incision approach appeared to cause less vascular disruption to the talar body while allowing more complete joint preparation."|From this cadaveric study, we found that both approaches could result in substantial disruption of the main blood supply to the talus.

One factor contributing to these falls may be reduced toe clearance during swing phase of the prosthesis. Quantitative gait data were acquired from ten persons with transfemoral amputations who were fitted with either single-axis or four-bar knees, in a cross-over experiment. Toe clearance during prosthetic swing phase was measured from these trials. To differentiate between effects on toe clearance attributed to knee mechanisms and those produced by compensatory gait deviations used by subjects, 3-D swing-leg simulations, incorporating models of the knee mechanisms, were applied to these empirical data. Additionally, two currently available prosthetic ankle mechanisms that dorsiflex to facilitate toe clearance during swing phase were modeled. Four-bar mechanisms had an empirical average of 2.2 cm more minimum toe clearance than single-axis knee mechanisms (p < 0.01). In the simulation study, single-axis knees provided the least clearance (4.6 cm) during prosthetic swing phase, followed by four-bar knees (5.8 cm), and the two ankle mechanisms (6.4 and 8.7 cm). Four-bar knees provide greater foot clearance during prosthetic swing phase than single-axis knees, but prosthetic ankle mechanisms that dorsiflex during swing phase provide substantially more.|||||10.1109/TNSRE.2012.2224885|2012-11-30|[{'lastname': 'Sensinger', 'firstname': 'Jonathon W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Department of PhysicalMedicine, Northwestern University, Chicago IL 60611, USA. sensinger@ieee.org'}, {'lastname': 'Intawachirarat', 'firstname': 'Nattaporn', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gard', 'firstname': 'Steven A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': None}]

This study analyzes how far a possible restoration of physiological mobility in the replaced ankle can also improve the function of the whole locomotor apparatus.
Twenty patients implanted with an original three-part ankle prosthesis were analyzed 12 months after surgery during stair climbing and descending. Standard gait analysis and motion tracking of the components by three-dimensional fluoroscopic analysis were performed on the same day using an established protocol and technique, respectively.
Nearly physiological ankle kinematic, kinetic and electromyography patterns were observed in the contralateral side in both motor activities, whereas these patterns were observed only during stair climbing in the operated side. Particularly, the mean ranges of flexion at the replaced ankle were 13° and 17° during stair climbing and descending, respectively. Corresponding 2.1 and 3.1mm antero/posterior meniscal-to-tibial translations were correlated with flexion between the two metal components (p<0.05). In addition, a larger tibiotalar flexion revealed by fluoroscopic analysis resulted in a physiological hip and knee moment.
The local and global functional performances of these patients were satisfactory, especially during stair climbing. These might be associated to the recovery of physiological kinematics at the replaced ankle, as also shown by the consistent antero/posterior motion of the meniscal bearing, according to the original concepts of this ankle replacement design."||||Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that the use of an intramedullary guide during a modular stem fixed-bearing total ankle replacement would decrease the incidence of perioperative complications and produce a similar incidence of complications across time. Because all patients were mobilized early, we also evaluated the influence of early mobilization on wound development. The medical records were reviewed to identify complications, and the radiographs were evaluated to determine the component alignment of the initial 58 consecutive ankles. Major wound complications were defined as complications requiring soft tissue coverage by a plastic surgeon. Minor wound complications were defined as those that could be treated without a return to the operating room. The procedures were separated into 2 groups: the initial 29 procedures (group A) and latter 29 procedures (group B). Eight ankles (14%) had wound complications. The incidence of complications was similar across time [r(s) (56) = -0.06, p = .64]. The incidence of complications and component misalignment was similar for groups A and B (p ≥ .19). All wounds were diagnosed within 15 days of surgery. None of the ankles developed wounds after physical therapy began. These results have demonstrated that the modular stem fixed-bearing total ankle replacement with intramedullary guidance can produce a similar incidence of complications over time, regardless of surgeon experience. Additionally, early mobilization did not appear to influence the incidence of wound complications and should be advocated, when appropriate.||||Copyright © 2013 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

831|23147469|[The plastic coverage of soft-tissue defects after endoprosthesis on the lower limb].|[]|Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie|"The implantation of endoprostheses is an established procedure in orthopaedic and trauma surgery. However, the techniques are often associated with a high risk of post-interventional infections and wound healing disorders that can result in loss of the prosthesis or the limb--most likely based on an insufficient debridement and poor soft-tissue coverage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the coverage methods in our patient population.
In the past 10 years 38 patients with exposed knee prostheses and 14 patients following an ankle endoprosthesis were included in this retrospective study over the period from 2001 to 2011. Soft-tissue reconstructions around the knee were mostly performed by unilateral or bilateral gastrocnemius flaps combined with split-skin grafts. One defect was covered with a free flap. 57% of the soft-tissue defects around the ankle are often problematic and were closed by a pedicled peroneus brevis muscle flap and 35% by a free flap (3 with a latissimus dorsi muscle flap, 2 with a free lateral upper arm flap and one with an anterolateral tight flap).
In our patient population we achieved stable soft-tissue coverage in most of the cases using the above-mentioned flaps. Due to multiple preexisting comorbidities, it was observed that the course was frequently prolonged and wound healing difficulties occurred. These, however, could be controlled by conservative means or small secondary procedures.
A radical debridement and an early appropriate defect coverage of the exposed prosthesis is crucial in the reconstruction process. Through a close interdisciplinary collaboration a stable soft-tissue covering can be achieved. Consequently it is possible to avoid a loss of the endoprosthesis, marked functional deficits or even amputations."|A radical debridement and an early appropriate defect coverage of the exposed prosthesis is crucial in the reconstruction process.

In this analysis of pooled data from four large, randomised, phase III clinical trials that compared the oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban with subcutaneous enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement (n = 12,729), the incidence of complications, including bleeding and adverse events related to surgery (such as wound infection, wound dehiscence and haemarthrosis) are reported. Interventions and procedures relating to surgery are also compared between the groups. Bleeding events, including excessive wound haematoma and surgical-site bleeding, occurred at similar rates in the rivaroxaban and enoxaparin groups. Over the total study duration, adverse surgical events occurred at a similar rate in the rivaroxaban group compared with the enoxaparin group after total knee replacement (2.26% vs. 2.69%, respectively) and total hip replacement (1.48% vs. 1.65%, respectively). Blood loss, wound drainage and transfusion requirements were also similar between the two groups.

Videofluoroscopy enables the in vivo measurement of the 3D kinematics of implant components more accurately than by means of skin marker tracking. The aim of the present preliminary study was to quantify the 3D kinematics of a TAA during the stance phase of level and slope walking using single plane videofluoroscopy.
The experimental set up consisted of a videofluoroscopy system (BV Pulsera, Philips Medical Systems, Switzerland, 25 Hz, 1 ms shutter time) integrated in a walkway, allowing the assessment of free level gait, uphill, downhill and cross-slope walking. 2D/3D registration was performed using the CAD models of the TAA. In a preliminary feasibility study, the presented method was applied on four patients with successful unilateral TAA (Mobility™ Total Ankle, DePuy) with good outcomes.
Isolated 3D TAA kinematics was quantified with a rotational and translational error of 0.2 degrees and 0.4 mm in plane and 1.3 degrees and 2.1 mm out of plane. In the feasibility study it was found that only minor limitations occurred in sagittal plane motion. Any restrictions were caused by a limitation in dorsiflexion, whereas plantarflexion was for all gait conditions sufficiently provided. Transverse and frontal plane rotation was marginal, the main rotation occurred around the talar construction axis itself.
The presented method enabled accurate estimation of the 3D TAA kinematics in vivo, without being limited by skin movement artifacts and isolated from subtalar motion. Since the available amount of dorsiflexion is the crucial factor to allow unrestrictive gait, walking uphill is an appropriate motion task to challenge and evaluate the performance of the TAA.
The presented method has the potential to identify specific kinematic patterns and thereby help clinicians and implant developers to evaluate current designs and future design modifications."|The presented method enabled accurate estimation of the 3D TAA kinematics in vivo, without being limited by skin movement artifacts and isolated from subtalar motion.

We report on clinical cases suffering soft tissue complications following TAA with the respective plastic surgical therapy regimen and present a simple algorithm for preoperative perfusion evaluation.
The medical records of 30 consecutive primary TAA patients were retrospectively reviewed after observing a higher than expected rate of severe soft tissue defects which have been referred to our plastic surgery department.

Wound closure could be reached in one case by conservative therapy consisting of regular dressing changes. In the further patients definite soft tissue reconstruction could only be performed by surgical intervention. One could be covered by split-thickness skin grafting and one by a microsurgical transplantation of a free latissimus dorsi flap. On the basis of these complications we established an easy algorithm for the preoperative evaluation of the arterial perfusion in the ankle region. First, (I) the pulses of the dorsal foot artery and posterior tibial artery should be examined. In the case of not palpable pulses (II) the ankle-brachial index should be performed. Values of <0.9 or >1.2 recommend (III) to perform angiography.

Forty-five subjects in four groups (AOA, AA, TAR, and control) were equipped with a wearable system consisting of inertial sensors installed on the tibia, calcaneus, and medial metatarsals. The subjects walked 50-m twice while the system measured the kinematic parameters of their multi-segment foot: the range of motion of joints between tibia, calcaneus, and medial metatarsals in three anatomical planes, and the peaks of angular velocity of these segments in the sagittal plane. These parameters were then compared among the four groups. It was observed that the range of motion and peak of angular velocities generally improved after TAR and were similar to the control subjects. However, unlike AOA and TAR, AA imposed impairments in the range of motion in the coronal plane for both the tibia-calcaneus and tibia-metatarsals joints. In general, the kinematic parameters showed significant correlation with established clinical scales (FFI and AOFAS), which shows their convergent validity. Based on the kinematic parameters of multi-segment foot during 50-m gait, this study showed significant improvements in foot mobility after TAR, but several significant impairments remained after AA.||||Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A series of images were acquired by videofluoroscopy at extremes of the range of motion, and during flexion/extension against gravity and stair-climbing/descending. Three-dimensional positions and orientations of the tibial and talar metal components and of the polyethylene mobile-bearing were obtained from the images by a standard shape-matching procedure. Motion between the three components was calculated and descriptively analyzed.
Large tibiotalar joint mobility of the replaced ankle was observed in all three anatomical planes, particularly in the sagittal. In flexion/extension against gravity, the mean range of flexion was 17.6, 17.7, and 16.2 degrees, respectively, over the three followups. The inclination angle of the mean axis of joint rotation was 3.7 degrees down and lateral in the frontal plane and 4.7 degrees posterior and lateral in the transverse plane, similar to those in the normal ankle.

Outcome measures included temporal-distance, kinematic and kinetic data, the Short Form 36 (SF-36) body pain score, and average daily step count. A mixed effects linear model was used to detect effects of surgical group (arthrodesis and arthroplasty, n = 9 each) with walking speed as a covariate (α = 0.05).
Both groups were similar in demographics and anthropometrics. Followup time was the same for each group. There were no complications in either group. Pain decreased (p < 0.001) and gait function improved (gait velocity, p = 0.02; stride length, p = 0.035) in both groups. Neither group increased average daily step count.

Lateral ligament reconstruction was done at the time of the surgery in 18 out of 19 patients. The radiographic parameters including the TAS and TAL showed no statistical significant improvement when compared pre and post operatively. The varus ankle tilt deformity improved from 18 degrees preoperatively to 10 degrees postoperatively (p < 0.05).

Soft-tissue contractures that result from varus or valgus coronal plane deformity can pose a difficult problem, and the surgeon should have a standard procedure for managing such situations in the operating room. Balance may be assessed intraoperatively with the use of spacer blocks, laminar spreaders, and tensioning devices as well as by placement of trial components. Techniques used to balance the varus or valgus ankle during primary total ankle arthroplasty include osteophyte resection, soft-tissue release, and bone resection.

Management consists of eradication of the infection and either, revision of the initial surgery or some form of salvage procedure. There are instances however when the patient is asymptomatic, medically unfit, or the local tissue is too tenuous to warrant performing additional surgery. We conducted a retrospective review of the outcome of the use of an antibiotic impregnated cement spacer as the definitive procedure in this kind of patient.
There were nine patients with post operative deep ankle infection following surgery who did not undergo subsequent revision surgery. The initial surgeries were either total ankle replacement (TAR) (n = 6) or ankle arthrodesis (n = 3). The indications for the retention of the cement spacer were patients who were asymptomatic following insertion of the cement spacer, did not desire further surgery, or were medically unfit for further surgery. The patients all underwent removal of hardware or implants, debridement, and insertion of an antibiotic impregnated cement spacer. Six weeks of intravenous antibiotics were administered according to culture sensitivity results. Patients were followed up closely for complications (wound dehiscence, spacer migration, bone loss), resolution of infection, functionality, and satisfaction.
The average time of cement spacer retention was 20.1 months, ranging from 6 to 62 months. The most common infecting organisms were Staph. Aureus (n = 3) and Staph. Epidermidis (n = 3). One patient had wound complications, possibly due to the proximity of the cement spacer to the anterior skin surface. One patient had a repeat infection at 52 months. The most common co-morbidities were rheumatoid arthritis (n = 3) and diabetes (n = 2). At final followup, seven patients still had a retained cement spacer and two had subsequent below knee amputations (BKA) performed as a result of delayed complications. Review of the X-rays revealed two patients with loosening and migration of the cement spacer. No patients had signs of excessive bone loss.

863|22727220|In vivo kinematics and articular surface congruency of total ankle arthroplasty during gait.|[]|Journal of biomechanics|Relatively high rates of loosening and implant failure have been reported after total ankle arthroplasty. Abnormal kinematics and incongruency of the articular surface may cause increased contact pressure and rotational torque applied to the implant, leading to loosening and implant failure. We measured in vivo kinematics of two-component total ankle arthroplasty (TNK ankle), and assessed congruency of the articular surface during the stance phase of gait. Eighteen ankles of 15 patients with a mean age of 75±6 years (mean±standard deviation) and follow-up of 44±38 months were enrolled. Lateral fluoroscopic images were taken during the stance phase of gait. 3D-2D model-image registration was performed using the fluoroscopic image and the implant models, and three-dimensional kinematics of the implant and incongruency of the articular surface were determined. The mean ranges of motion were 11.1±4.6°, 0.8±0.4°, and 2.6±1.5° for dorsi-/plantarflexion, inversion/eversion, and internal/external rotation, respectively. At least one type of incongruency of the articular surface occurred in eight of 18 ankles, including anterior hinging in one ankle, medial or lateral lift off in four ankles, and excessive axial rotation in five ankles. Among the four ankles in which lift off occurred during gait, only one ankle showed lift off in the static weightbearing radiograph. Our observations will provide useful data against which kinematics of other implant designs, such as three-component total ankle arthroplasty, can be compared. Our results also showed that evaluation of lift off in the standard weightbearing radiograph may not predict its occurrence during gait.||||Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

866|22632709|Total joint arthroplasty for persons with osteoarthritis.|[]|PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation|Osteoarthritis is a process largely associated with aging, and Americans today are living longer than ever before, with the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing an average life expectancy of 78.2 years. With an increasingly older society, there will be an increased need for medical and surgical treatment of osteoarthritis. At the same time, a decline in the number of surgeons performing total joint arthroplasty is anticipated, by as much as 30% in some studies. Due to this anticipated shortage, nonoperative physicians will play a more prominent role in patient care and should become better educated in maximizing nonoperative care, recognizing appropriate surgical indications, and educating their patients on surgical outcomes. Total joint arthroplasty offers pain relief and potential functional improvement. Unfortunately, the outcomes for joint replacement differ significantly by the joint being replaced. The best examples of positive outcome for both pain relief and functional improvement are total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. Shoulder arthroplasty has demonstrated encouraging outcomes but the outcome data is not yet as robust as the data for hip and knee arthroplasty. Elbow arthroplasty provides good pain relief but functional outcomes are not nearly as good, and significant potential complications exist. Lastly, ankle arthroplasty has not demonstrated outcomes that are as positive as the other major joints, and the criterion standard treatment continues to be ankle fusion. In this article, surgical options for arthroplasty will be reviewed for each of the major joints, including the joint-specific indications and outcomes for each procedure.||||Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

868|22627031|RANKL in the osteolysis of AES total ankle replacement implants.|[]|Bone|Peri-implant tissue reactions in failed total ankle replacement (TAR) are characterized by early developing peri-implant osteolysis. The hypothesis of the study was that this reaction is mediated by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL). Samples of peri-prosthetic tissues from failed TAR implants were stained for macrophages, RANKL, its receptor RANK and osteoprotegerin (OPG), and compared to control samples. The failed TAR implants were surrounded by implant capsule, synovial lining-like interface membrane or necrotic tissues. Infiltrating scavenger receptor I positive CD163(+) macrophages were frequent, in particular around necrotic soft tissues or bone sequestrate, and possibly in part formed due to ischemia and mechanical factors. In contrast, implant-derived wear debris was scanty. Still many RANK(+) macrophages were often seen in close contact with RANKL(+) mesenchymal cells, whereas OPG was mostly located at a distance in vascular endothelial cells. Foreign body giant cells were frequent. RANKL seems to stimulate locally accumulated CD163(+) RANK-expressing cells to fusion, which leads to the local formation of multinuclear foreign body giant cells (and probably of osteoclasts). Therefore, peri-implant osteolysis in early TAR implant failure seems to be caused by the RANKL-driven chronic foreign body inflammation directed against, not implant-derived particles, but against necrotic autologous tissues.||||Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

""The difficulty of performing a total ankle replacement and the corresponding steep learning curve"" has resulted in a proposal ""to limit ankle replacement to centers that have performed at least ten total ankle replacements for at least 3 years"". The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the frequency of TAA procedures on the complications and outcome of these arthroplasties.
This retrospective series included 183 cases who underwent surgery between 1997-2010 in eight centers: three high volume centers performed at least five TAA per year (100 cases) and six low volume centers performed less than five TAA per year (78 cases).
The clinical assessment was performed in 133 cases that were reviewed after a mean 39 months ± 29 of follow-up. The preoperative AOFAS score was 33 ± 4 and 77 ± 15 at the final follow-up. The five-year survival rate was 86%. No significant difference was found between the groups for the AOFAS score or implant survival at the final follow-up. The high volume centers experienced more complications (45% versus 13%) but fewer implant failures (8% versus 13%) overall compared to the low volume centers.
The outcome of TAA depends mainly upon the pertinence of the indication and the associated procedures that may be necessary. Rather than limiting TAA to high volume reference centers, we suggest that the assessment of each case within a predetermined area should be done in a network. This would determine the degree of specialization required for each TAA case and provide all patients with safe and equal access to this therapeutic option.

871|22588415|Functional disabilities and issues of concern for Asian patients before total ankle arthroplasty.|[]|Orthopedics|Total ankle arthroplasty is a commonly performed invasive procedure that can be distressing to patients. Therefore, surgeons should consider patients' issues of greatest interest and concerns at the time of surgery and the function that patients hope to recover. Many studies have reported surgeon concerns before total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty, but few have focused on patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients' functional disabilities and issues of concern regarding total ankle arthroplasty.Between May 2008 and June 2010, eighty-five patients (52 men and 33 women; mean age, 60 years) were recruited for the study. All patients were asked to complete a questionnaire divided into 3 parts: sociodemographic data, current functional disabilities and their perceived importance, and issues concerning patients before total ankle arthroplasty. Regarding functional disability based on severity, the top 5 issues were limping, difficulty squatting, daytime pain, difficulty kneeling, and difficulty climbing stairs. Regarding functional disability based on perceived importance, the top 5 issues were daytime pain, limping, difficulty walking, difficulty kneeling, and difficulty working. Regarding issues of concern, the top 5 issues were pain intraoperatively, ability to walk as much as desired, ability to climb stairs, pain after discharge from the hospital, and pain immediately postoperatively. The most important issue before total ankle arthroplasty was pain. Patients had a strong interest in high ankle extension and increased range of motion due to the lifestyle and religious activities of Eastern populations.||||Copyright 2012, SLACK Incorporated.|10.3928/01477447-20120426-27|2012-05-17|[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Kyung Tai', 'initials': 'KT', 'affiliation': 'Foot and Ankle Clinic, KT Lee’s Orthopedic Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Jae Hyuck', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Young Koo', 'initials': 'YK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Young', 'firstname': 'Ki Won', 'initials': 'KW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jun Beom', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jin Su', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Wook Joong', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jun Ho', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Ji Yun', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': None}]

American volume|"End-stage arthritis may be associated with increased body mass index (BMI). Overweight patients with ankle arthritis often request surgery in the hope that this will allow them to initiate a weight loss program.
One hundred and forty-five overweight (BMI = 25.1 to 29.9 kg/m2) or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) patients who had successful ankle replacement or ankle fusion, as defined by the absence of revision ankle surgery and a postoperative improvement in the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) score, were identified in a retrospective cohort ankle database. Their BMIs at six months and one, two, and five years postoperatively were compared with their preoperative BMI as the primary outcome measure. Linear regression analysis was used to correlate the outcome scores against BMI with time.
No significant change in the mean BMI, compared with the preoperative BMI, was found at six months or one, two, or five years postoperatively, despite significant improvement in the AOS and Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary scores at all time points. The factor that most strongly correlated with postoperative BMI was preoperative BMI.
Pain and disability are significantly reduced in overweight and obese patients after successful ankle replacement or fusion. Despite this, the mean BMI remains unchanged after the surgery, indicating that weight loss does not commonly occur following successful ankle reconstruction in this patient population.

However, compensatory motion at the subtalar and midtarsal joints might also contribute to the amount of ankle DF obtained by goniometric measurements. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of goniometric alignment on DF range of motion measurement among patients following ankle arthrodesis or arthroplasty and age- and gender-matched controls. A total of 22 participants were recruited to participate in this observational cohort study, including 7 patients following total ankle arthroplasty (2 male, 5 female; mean age = 67.5 years, standard deviation [SD] = 9.6 years), 4 patients following ankle arthrodesis (2 male, 2 female; mean age = 70.5 years, SD = 5.2 years), and 11 age- and gender-matched controls (4 male, 7 female; mean age 67.5 years, SD = 9.0 years). Two investigators measured and recorded ankle DF passive range of motion (PROM) using a randomly determined sequence of 2 alignment methods: (1) the distal aspect of the lateral calcaneus, and (2) the fifth metatarsal. One-sample t tests were performed to assess differences in ankle DF between the 2 different alignment methods. Significantly greater degrees of DF were obtained when aligning with the fifth metatarsal versus the lateral calcaneus on the patients' uninvolved sides and the randomly selected side of matched controls (P < .05) but not on the patients' operative side (P > .05). This study found that more degrees of DF PROM are measured when aligning a goniometer with the fifth metatarsal versus the calcaneus on the uninvolved side of patients and matched controls.

We evaluated the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the modified Swedish version of the questionnaire (SEFAS) in patients with osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis before and/or after their ankle was replaced or fused.
The questionnaire was translated into Swedish and cross-culturally adapted according to a standardized procedure. It was sent to 135 patients with ankle arthritis who were scheduled for or had undergone surgery, together with the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS), the short form 36 (SF-36) score, and the EuroQol (EQ-5D) score. Construct validity was evaluated with Spearman's correlation coefficient when comparing SEFAS with FAOS, SF-36, and EQ-5D, content validity by calculating floor and ceiling effects, test-retest reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha (n = 62), agreement by Bland-Altman plot, and responsiveness by effect size and standardized response mean (n = 37).
For construct validity, we correlated SEFAS with the other scores and 70% or more of our predefined hypotheses concerning correlations could be confirmed. There were no floor or ceiling effects.

We measured the length, width, height, and angles of the distal tibia and talus of 51 cadavers and compared these measurements with the corresponding dimensions of the HINTEGRA prostheses. The male ankles were larger than the female ones as was expected, but their overall shapes did not differ, which fact validates use of the prostheses irrespective of patients' sex. The dimensions of the talus itself did not differ significantly from those previously reported for American whites and blacks and South African whites. This might suggest a possibility that the HINTEGRA prostheses, being used in these countries, would be compatible to Korean ankles, too. In fact, the length range of the talar components was generally compatible with those derived from cadaveric measurements of the trochlea. However, the widths of the tibial and talar components were not completely compatible to Korean ankles. Above all, the length of the large-sized tibial components was much longer than the largest ankles, which would confine the choice of prosthesis mainly to small-sized ones for arthroplasty in Korea. Even though these prostheses are currently used, some modifications are needed to extend their usability in Korea, such as shortening and width/length ratio adjustment of the tibial component, and of the talar component accordingly.||||Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|10.1002/ca.22043|2012-02-04|[{'lastname': 'Eun', 'firstname': 'Sang Soo', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Wooridul Spine Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Woo-Chun', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Sang-Ho', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Paik', 'firstname': 'Doo Jin', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hwang', 'firstname': 'Young-I L', 'initials': 'YI', 'affiliation': None}]

The purpose of this study was to determine, based on clinical and radiographic outcomes, the technical requirements and additional procedures that should be performed in such indications.
Coronal deformities greater than 10° are not a contraindication to TAR if a stable and aligned ankle can be obtained after surgery.
Of a total of 131 TAR, 21 were performed on coronal plane deformities greater than 10°. Only cases of osteoarthritis secondary to fracture or chronic instability were included. Inflammatory ankles were excluded. Twenty-one patients (15 men and 6 women), mean age 57 years old (±12) were reviewed retrospectively with a mean follow-up of 38 months (±26). Patients were divided into four groups, categorizing first, congruent and incongruent ankles, and second varus and valgus deformities. Associated procedures were performed from proximal to distal, correcting periarticular malunions first, ligament imbalances, associated deformities of the foot and equinus deformity. Revision arthrodesis and implant changes due to loosening or progressive instability were considered to be failures.
Surgery resulted in improved functional outcome and durable correction of the deformity, passing from 16.5° (±4.9) to 2.5° (±3.9) for varus, and from 16.7° (±5.6) to 1.4° (±2.1) for valgus. Six varus ankles required revision surgery for further corrections. Three incongruent ankles failed.
Correction of osteoarticular deformities and ligament imbalance in case of frontal deformities requires a significant number of associated procedures. Residual defects are detrimental to implant longevity and warrant further correction. Short-term results are satisfactory even for severe deformities, but require longer-term monitoring.

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference|Modern passive prosthetic foot/ankles cannot adapt to variations in ground slope. The lack of active adaptation significantly compromises an amputee's balance and stability on uneven terrains. To address this deficit, this paper proposes an ankle prosthesis that uses semi-active damping as a mechanism to provide active slope adaptation. The conceptual ankle prosthesis consists of a modulated damper in series with a spring foot that allows the foot to conform to the angle of the surface in the sagittal plane. In support of this approach, biomechanics data is presented showing unilateral transtibial amputees stepping on a wedge with their daily-use passive prosthesis. Based on this data, a simulation of the ankle prosthesis with semi-active damping is developed. The model shows the kinematic adaptation of the prosthesis to sudden changes in ground slope. The results show the potential of an ankle prosthesis with semi-active damping to actively adapt to the ground slope at each step.|||||10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090110|2012-01-19|[{'lastname': 'LaPrè', 'firstname': 'Andrew K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, USA. alapree@ student.umass.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Sup', 'firstname': 'Frank', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}]

There were 61 male (51.7%) and 57 female (48.3%) patients with a mean age of 59.8 +/- 11.6 years (range, 25.4 to 85.0). All patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively (mean followup 67.7 +/- 27.0 months; range, 29 to 126). Radiological outcomes were assessed using standardized weightbearing radiographs. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scale.
There were nine intraoperative complications. All patients experienced significant pain relief (VAS change from 7.0 +/- 1.7 to 1.4 +/- 1.1, p < 0.001) and functional improvement (AOFAS score change from 35.4 +/- 14.9 to 75.4 +/- 9.6, p < 0.001; total ROM change from 26.9 +/- 13.7 to 35.3 +/- 8.1 degrees, p < 0.001). BMI measured preoperatively, and at 1 and 2 years postoperatively was 32.9 +/- 2.5 (range, 30.0 to 40.0) kg/m2, 32.4 +/- 2.4 (range, 28.6 to 41.0) kg/m2, and 32.2 +/- 2.4 (range, 28.6 to 40.5) kg/m2, respectively. Gender had a significant effect on weight loss, but not age or postoperative sports activity. Revision surgery was performed in six patients, resulting in a 6-year survivorship of 93%.
Our findings confirm that TAR gives significant pain relief and functional improvement. In this study, the survivorship of the prosthesis components was comparable to the results obtained in non-obese patients."|Our findings confirm that TAR gives significant pain relief and functional improvement.

American volume|"The purpose of the present study was to document the patient self-reported improvements in quality of life, function, and overall impairment scores, as well as the improvement in the clinically derived outcome scores, following a Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) arthroplasty performed for the treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis.
All patients who underwent a Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement arthroplasty from July 1998 through February 2008 were prospectively followed and retrospectively reviewed. All surgical procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Preoperatively and at subsequent follow-up visits, patients were assessed with (1) a visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, (2) the Short Form-36 (SF-36) quality-of-life scale, (3) the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scale and subscales, (4) the Buechel-Pappas pain and function scores, and (5) the ankle range of motion. Additional measures that were recorded included (1) concomitant surgical procedures during the initial ankle replacement, (2) revision surgery during the follow-up period, and (3) any additional surgical procedures. Revision was defined as failure of either the tibial or the talar metallic component that required removal of a metallic implant for any reason.
Eighty-two consecutive patients were evaluated. The duration of follow-up ranged from twenty-four to 108 months (mean, sixty-one months; median, sixty months). During the follow-up period, three patients died and six patients moved out of the region. The latter six patients were followed by another surgeon group, and their data were included. Eight patients were lost to follow-up after twelve months. There were significant improvements in all outcome categories between the preoperative and postoperative evaluations. The most compelling finding of the present study involved the marked improvement in terms of the self-reported measures of impairments, quality of life, pain, and function.

I undertook a systematic review of electronic databases and other relevant sources to identify material relating to the incidence of revision after primary implantation of the Agility™ Total Ankle Replacement System. In an effort to procure the highest quality studies available, studies were eligible for inclusion only if they involved patients undergoing primary Agility™ Total Ankle Replacement; had evaluated patients at a mean follow-up of 12 months or longer; included details of the revision performed; and included revision etiologies of aseptic loosening, ballooning osteolysis, cystic changes, malalignment, or instability. A total of 14 studies involving 2312 ankles, with a weighted mean follow-up of 22.8 months, were included. Of the 2312 ankles, 224 (9.7%) underwent revision, of which 182 (81.3%) underwent implant component replacement, 34 (15.2%) underwent arthrodesis, and 8 (3.6%) underwent below-knee amputation. No significant effect from the surgeon's learning curve on the incidence of revision or the type of revision surgery performed was identified. However, excluding the inventor increased the incidence of revision twofold, from 6.6% to 12.2%, and skewed the type of revision away from arthrodesis and toward implant component replacement or below-knee amputation. Regardless, the incidence of revision after primary implantation of the Agility™ Total Ankle Replacement System was less than historically reported and amenable to implant component revision more than 80% of the time. However, methodologically sound cohort studies are needed that include the outcomes after revision surgery, specifically focusing on what implant component replacement techniques are effective in enhancing survivorship of these revised implants and the role of custom-stemmed talar and tibial components have in revision of the Agility™ Total Ankle Replacement System. A direct comparison of the incidence of revision between the various contemporary total ankle replacement systems in common use is also warranted.||||Copyright © 2012 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Comparison of sports, recreational activities and functional outcome.|[]|International orthopaedics|"Ankle arthrodesis (AAD) and total ankle replacement (TAR) are the major surgical treatment options for severe ankle arthritis. There is an ongoing discussion in the orthopaedic community whether ankle arthrodesis or ankle fusion should be the treatment of choice for end stage osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study was to compare the participation in sports and recreational activities in patients who underwent either AAD or TAR for end-stage osteoarthritis of the ankle.
A total of 41 patients (21 ankle arthrodesis /20 TAR) were examined at 34.5 (SD18.0) months after surgery. At follow-up, pre- and postoperative participation in sports and recreational activities has been assessed. Activity levels were determined using the ankle activity score according to Halasi et al. and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale. Clinical and functional outcome was assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score. The percentage of patients participating in sports and recreational activities, UCLA score and AOFAS score were compared between both treatment groups.
In the AAD group 86% were active in sports preoperatively and in the TAR group this number was 76%. Postoperatively in both groups 76% were active in sports (AAD, p = 0.08). The UCLA score was 7.0 (± 1.9) in the AAD group and 6.8 (± 1.8) in the TAR group (p = 0.78). The AOFAS score reached 75.6 (± 14) in the AAD group and 75.6 (± 16) in the TAR group (p = 0.97). The ankle activity score decrease was statistically significant for both groups (p = 0.047).

We now present an extended series with a longer follow-up, and with a 10-year survival analysis.
Records of uncemented 3-component TARs were retrospectively reviewed, determining risk factors such as age, sex, and diagnosis. Prosthetic survival rates were calculated with exchange or removal of components as endpoint-excluding incidental exchange of the polyethylene meniscus.
Of the 780 prostheses implanted since 1993, 168 (22%) had been revised by June 15, 2010. The overall survival rate fell from 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79-0.83) at 5 years to 0.69 (95% CI: 0.67-0.71) at 10 years. The survival rate was higher, although not statistically significantly so, during the latter part of the period investigated. Excluding the STAR prosthesis, the survival rate for all the remaining designs was 0.78 at 10 years. Women below the age of 60 with osteoarthritis were at a higher risk of revision, but age did not influence the outcome in men or women with rheumatoid arthritis. Revisions due to technical mistakes at the index surgery and instability were undertaken earlier than revisions for other reasons.
The results have slowly improved during the 18-year period investigated.

American volume|"Total ankle replacement has become an increasingly popular treatment for patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. The surgery is technically demanding and generally performed by only experienced foot and ankle surgeons. An important complication of total ankle replacement is malposition of the talar component. The biomechanical effect of malposition has been reported; however, the functional outcomes of patients with varying degrees of talar component malposition have not. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of talar component malposition on postoperative pain relief and functional outcome.
This retrospective cohort study included 317 total ankle replacements in 317 patients. The anteroposterior offset ratio was measured with use of lateral ankle radiographs made with the patient in a standing, weight-bearing position. Patients were classified into one of three groups: those with an anteroposterior offset ratio of 0 (127 ankles), those with a ratio of >0 (103 ankles), and those with a ratio of <0 (eighty-seven ankles). Postoperative pain relief was assessed with use of a visual analogue scale. Functional outcome was assessed with the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score and measurement of ankle range of motion. The mean duration of follow-up (and standard deviation) was 53.2 ± 18.4 months (range, twenty-four to ninety-eight months).
The postoperative pain level in the group with an anteroposterior offset ratio of 0 was significantly lower than that for both the group with a ratio of >0 (p < 0.001) and the group with a ratio of <0 (p = 0.017). Also, the functional outcome, measured with use of the AOFAS hindfoot score, was significantly higher, and ankle motion was significantly greater, in the group with an anteroposterior offset ratio of 0 than in the group with a ratio of >0 (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively) and the group with a ratio of <0 (p = 0.007 and p = 0.080).
The anteroposterior offset ratio may be a useful predictor of outcome in patients with total ankle replacement with regard to both pain and function.

American volume|"There is a resurgence of popularity with regard to total ankle arthroplasty, although there are limited data documenting the effect of total ankle arthroplasty on ankle joint motion, gait, or ankle function. The purpose of this study was to perform a prospective evaluation of the effect of the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement on gait.
We prospectively studied fifty consecutive patients with advanced ankle arthritis who underwent unilateral total ankle arthroplasty with the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement ankle prosthesis. Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed with use of a twelve-camera digital-motion capture system. Kinetic parameters were collected with use of two force plates. Temporal-spatial measurements included stride length and cadence. The kinematic parameters that were measured included the sagittal plane range of motion of the ankle, knee, and hip. The kinetic parameters that were studied included ankle plantar flexion-dorsiflexion moment and sagittal plane ankle power. The mean period of follow-up was forty-nine months (range, twenty-four to 108 months).
Temporal-spatial analysis showed that walking velocity increased as a function of increases in both cadence and stride length, and to significant levels for each. Kinematic analysis showed that ankle range of motion increased from a mean of 14.2° to 17.9° (p < 0.001), with the increase coming from increased plantar flexion. Increased motion was also measured at the hip and knee. Significant increases were found in ankle power (from 0.69 to 1.00 W/kg [p < 0.001]) and ankle plantar flexion moment (from 0.88 to 1.09 Nm/kg [p < 0.001]).
This study demonstrated that, at the time of intermediate-term follow-up and in comparison with the effects of ankle arthrodesis on gait as reported in previous studies, total ankle arthroplasty was associated with a more normal ankle function and a more normal gait, both kinetically and in terms of temporal-spatial parameters. More importantly, the study demonstrated marked improvement in multiple, objective parameters of gait following total ankle arthroplasty as compared with the patient's own preoperative function. The long-term maintenance of the gait improvements will require further study."|||Temporal-spatial analysis showed that walking velocity increased as a function of increases in both cadence and stride length, and to significant levels for each.

900|22009496|[Total ankle arthroplasty in valgus ankle osteoarthritis].|[]|Der Orthopade|Ankle osteoarthritis (OA) is often associated with deformities. Valgus OA is less frequent than varus OA and causes of valgus OA include medial ligament instability, flat foot and posttraumatic situations, e.g. fractures of the fibula or lateral tibial plafond. The importance of the mechanical axis is generally accepted in orthopedic surgery. In cases of implantation of total ankle replacements the normal biomechanics need to be restored in order to have a correct and pain-free functioning total ankle replacement both in the short and long-term. The two most important criteria are (1) an anterior tibio-talar angle of about 90° and (2) a neutral hindfoot position. The hindfoot position is measured with the hindfoot alignment view according to Saltzman. In this view, healthy feet are in neutral or minimal varus position of 1-2° and not in a valgus position as generally assumed. The following operative steps are performed depending on the degree and localization of the valgus deformity: (1) total ankle replacement, (2) supramalleolar or (3) inframalleolar osteotomy/arthrodesis, (4) medial ligament repair, (5) fibula osteotomy and (6) syndesmotic reconstruction.|||||10.1007/s00132-011-1825-3|2011-10-20|[{'lastname': 'Valderrabano', 'firstname': 'V', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Abteilung Orthopädie, Universitätsklinikum Basel, Spitalstr. 21, CH-4031, Basel, Schweiz. vvalderrabano@uhbs.ch'}, {'lastname': 'Frigg', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Leumann', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Horisberger', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]

903|21996936|[Revision arthroplasty of the ankle joint].|[]|Der Orthopade|In the last 20 years total ankle replacement has become a viable alternative to arthrodesis for end-stage osteoarthritis of the ankle. Numerous ankle prosthesis designs have appeared on the market in the past and attracted by the encouraging intermediate results reported in the literature, many surgeons have started to perform this procedure. With increased availability on the market the indications for total ankle replacement have also increased in recent years. In particular, total ankle replacement may now be considered even in younger patients. Therefore, despite progress in total ankle arthroplasty the number of failures may increase. Up to now, arthrodesis was considered to be the gold standard for salvage of failed ankle prostheses. Because of extensive bone loss on the talar side, in most instances tibiocalcaneal fusion is the only reliable solution. An alternative to such extended hindfoot fusions would be revision arthroplasty. To date, however, there are no reported results of revision arthroplasty for salvage of a failed ankle replacement.Based on our experience prosthetic components with a flat undersurface are most likely to be able to find solid support on remaining bone stock. The first 83 cases (79 patients, 46 males, 33 females, average age 58.9 years, range 30.6-80.7 years) with a average follow-up of 5.4 years (range 2-11 years) showed excellent to good results in 69 cases (83%), a satisfactory result in 12 cases (15%) and a fair result in 2 cases (2%) and 47 patients (56%) were pain free. Primary loosening was noted in three cases and of these two cases were successfully revised by another total ankle replacement and in one case with arthrodesis. Another case with hematogenous infection was also revised by arthrodesis. At the last follow-up control two components were considered to be loose and the overall loosening rate was thus 6%.This series has proven that revision arthroplasty can be a promising option for patients with failed total ankle prosthesis. The most challenging issue is the solid anchoring of available components on residual bone. More experience is needed, however, to better define the possibilities and limitations of revision arthroplasty.|||||10.1007/s00132-011-1829-z|2011-10-15|[{'lastname': 'Hintermann', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Klinik für Orthopädie und Traumatologie des Bewegungsapparates, Kantonsspital Liestal, Rheinstr. 26, CH-4410, Liestal, Schweiz. beat.hintermann@ksli.ch'}, {'lastname': 'Barg', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Knupp', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]

In such cases, rehabilitation of TKA is limited by debilitating ankle pain, but varus or valgus ankle arthritis may even compromise placement of knee prosthetic components.
We present a patient with simultaneous bilateral valgus and patellofemoral OA of the knees and bilateral varus OA of the ankle joints that equally contributed to overall disability. This 63 years old, motivated and otherwise healthy patient was treated by simultaneous bilateral total knee and ankle arthroplasty (quadruple total joint arthroplasty, TJA) during the same anesthesia. Two years outcome showed excellent alignment and function of all four replaced joints. Postoperative time for rehabilitation, back to work (6th week) and hospital stay (12 days) of this special patient was markedly reduced compared to the usual course of separate TJA.
Simultaneous quadruple TJA in equally disabling OA of bilateral deformed knees and ankles resulted in a better functional outcome and faster recovery compared to the average reported results after TKA and TAA in literature. However, careful preoperative planning, extensive patient education, and two complete surgical teams were considered essential for successful performance.

905|21989688|[Medial pain syndrome in patients with total ankle replacement].|[]|Der Orthopade|Total ankle replacement is an increasingly recommended treatment for patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. The increasing experience with this procedure explains its acceptance as a therapeutic option in complex cases as part of reconstruction surgery. However, the complication rate including failure of the prosthesis should not be underestimated. Previous studies have shown that most patients developed ankle osteoarthritis secondary to previous trauma. Patients with posttraumatic osteoarthritis often have varus or valgus misalignment of the hindfoot. In cases with incorrectly addressed hindfoot misalignment and/or incorrectly positioned prosthesis components, pain may remain postoperatively because of biomechanical dysbalance and asymmetrical load. The pain is mostly localized on the medial side the so-called medial pain syndrome.The following classification of the medial pain syndrome has been established in our practice: type I medial impingement/contracture of medial ligaments, type II valgus deformity, type III varus deformity, type IV combined varus-valgus deformity.|||||10.1007/s00132-011-1828-0|2011-10-13|[{'lastname': 'Barg', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Klinik für Orthopädie und Traumatologie des Bewegungsapparates, Kantonsspital Liestal, Rheinstr. 26, CH-4410, Liestal, Schweiz. alexejbarg@mail.ru'}, {'lastname': 'Suter', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zwicky', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Knupp', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hintermann', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]

The gold standard in these circumstances is still tibiocalcaneal arthrodesis with all the negative aspects of a completely rigid hindfoot. We started 10 years ago to replace the talus by a custom-made, all cobalt-chrome implant (laser sintering). The first patient with a giant cell tumor did very well but the following patients showed all subsidence of the metal talus into the tibia due to missing bony edges. Therefore, we constructed a custom-made talus (mirrored from the healthy side) and combined it with a well functioning total ankle prosthesis (Hintegra). So far we have implanted this custom-made implant into 3 patients: the first had a chondrosarcoma of the talus (1 year follow-up), the second had massive osteolysis/necrosis of unknown origin (6 months follow-up) and the third massive osteolysis following a correct TAR (2 months follow-up). The results are very encouraging as all of the patients are practically pain free and have a good range of movement (ROM): D-P flexion 15°-0-20° but less motion in the lower ankle joint: ROM P-S 5°-0-5°. No subsidence was detected  in the tibia or the calcaneus. The custom-made talus combined with the Hintegra total ankle replacement will probably be an interesting alternative to a tibiocalcaneal arthrodesis in selected cases with massive defects of the talus.|||||10.1007/s00132-011-1826-2|2011-10-13|[{'lastname': 'Lampert', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Orthopädie am Rosenberg, Klinik Hirslanden-Stephanshorn, Brauerstr. 95, CH-9016, St. Gallen, Schweiz. christoph.lampert@orh.ch'}]

With the advent of the newer generation of total ankle replacement (TAR), a viable option over an arthrodesis is now available for patients with end-stage ankle arthritis. When compared with an ankle arthroplasty, recent reports suggest the ankle arthrodesis has poor long-term outcomes (20 years+) and can experience short- and long-term complications. Proper training, strict patient selection, and proper implant contribute to a successful outcome. As advances continue to be made in both implant design and surgical technique, the benefits of a TAR appears to provide the foot and ankle surgeon a good alternative for the appropriate patient.||||Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The present study analyzed the clinical and radiographic results of the first 240 total ankle arthroplasties performed by the authors with one of these new three-component prostheses.
Two hundred and forty consecutive primary total ankle arthroplasties were performed in 233 patients (115 women and 118 men; mean age, 61.6 years) between November 2003 and October 2007 with the Mobility prosthesis. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, reoperations, and failures were recorded. The American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot score and a visual analog scale score assessment of pain were determined at each follow-up visit. Range of ankle motion was measured on functional radiographs, and the radiographs were studied to assess component positioning, radiolucencies, new bone formation, and periprosthetic bone cysts.
Two hundred and thirty-three of the arthroplasties were available for follow-up at least one year after surgery. The mean duration of follow-up was 32.8 ± 15.3 months. There were ten intraoperative complications (4.2%) and twenty postoperative complications (8.6%). A reoperation was necessary in eighteen ankles (7.7%). Five arthroplasties (2.1%) failed at a mean of twenty-seven months after surgery. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society hindfoot score improved from 48.2 to 84.1 points (p < 0.001). The mean pain level decreased from 7.7 to 1.7 points (p < 0.001). The mean total range of ankle motion improved from 19.8° to 21.9° (p < 0.001).

The pooled mean five year survival rate was 85.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 80.9-90.3], and the pooled mean ten year survival rate was 71.1% (95% CI 60.9-81.5). Pooled failure rate was 11.1% (95% CI 7.6 -14.9), with a mean follow-up time of 52 months; 41% failed within one year of initial operation. The first three reasons associated with implant failure were aseptic loosening (5.2%), malalignment (1.7%) and deep infection (1.0%).
We found that STAR prosthesis achieved encouraging results in terms of intermediate to long-term outcome. The five and ten year survival rates were acceptable. However, the failure rate was still high. The major reasons for implant failure were aseptic loosening and malalignment. Maybe the increase of surgeons' experience and patient selection could improve outcomes and decrease failure rate."|||Sixteen primary studies with 2,088 implants were identified.

913|21868797|Revision total ankle replacement: an early look at agility to INBONE.|[]|Foot & ankle specialist|INTRODUCTION. The role of total ankle replacement (TAR) is expanding in the United States. As the number of ankles implanted increases, undoubtedly the number of failures will increase. Several reports in the literature have dealt with salvage of the failed TAR through various methods. MeTHODS. A retrospective chart and radiographic review was performed on all patients who had conversion from a failed Agility TAR to an INBONE TAR at 2 centers and had been performed at least 12 months prior to the study. Exclusion criteria included any patient converted from a different type of TAR, primary TAR, patients followed less than 12 months, and surgical approach other than the standard anterior incision. RESULTS. Five patients met inclusion criteria. The average age was 65.6 ± 13.6 years (range = 45-79 years). Complicating comorbidities were found with 4 patients. The average follow-up was 17.2 ± 6.6 months (range = 7-25 months). The cause of failure of the original Agility TAR was coronal plane deformity in 3 patients, and 1 patient each failed from extensive heterotopic ossification or infection. All patients presented with pain. In 4 cases, there was component subsidence at the talus, tibia, or both. All patients had adjunctive procedures at the time of the revision, including malleolar screw placement in 4 patients and hindfoot arthrodesis in 2 patients. All patients had either 4 or 5 tibial stem components placed. During the follow-up period, 3 patients required additional surgery, including 2 patients classified as failures (1 transtibial amputation and 1 tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis). DISCUSSION. This salvage option is technically demanding. The authors caution against TAR revision by conversion in the place of previous infection and in ankle imbalance not amenable to reconstruction. In all cases the initial deformity was corrected. The early results, however, demonstrate high risk of early failure and positional changes.|||||10.1177/1938640011411083|2011-08-27|[{'lastname': 'Devries', 'firstname': 'J George', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Center, Westerville, Ohio, USA. ofacresearch@orthofootankle.com'}, {'lastname': 'Berlet', 'firstname': 'Gregory C', 'initials': 'GC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Thomas H', 'initials': 'TH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hyer', 'firstname': 'Christopher F', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Deorio', 'firstname': 'James K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': None}]

This study was performed to determine which is a better choice for ankle arthritis, using a decision analysis and Markov model to reflect the repetitive nature of revision arthroplasty.
Based on current published evidence, a decision tree was constructed to compare the clinical outcomes of total ankle arthroplasty and arthrodesis, which contained the possible clinical events and the probabilities. Total ankle arthroplasty was subject to revision arthroplasty, and a Markov model was adopted for this branch to reflect this repetitive trait of the procedure. Arthrodesis could cause adjacent arthritis, and a conventional decision analysis model was adopted for this branch. Quality well-being index score was used for clinical outcome assessment, which was the utility in the decision tree. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the stability of the decision tree and the threshold values.
The model favoured total ankle arthroplasty over arthrodesis in terms of quality well-being index score. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model was considerably stable, unaffected by the changes in probabilities of failure after total ankle arthroplasty and adjacent arthritis after arthrodesis.
Based on current evidence, total ankle arthroplasty was found to be a better treatment than arthrodesis for ankle arthritis. Future development in the implant materials, improved understanding of ankle biomechanics, and surgical techniques will further enhance the clinical outcome of total ankle arthroplasty."|||The model favoured total ankle arthroplasty over arthrodesis in terms of quality well-being index score.

915|21840736|Early clinical results of the BOX ankle replacement are satisfactory: a multicenter feasibility study of 158 ankles.|[]|The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons|A new design for a 3-part ankle replacement was developed in an effort to achieve compatibility with the naturally occurring ligaments of the ankle by allowing certain fibers to remain isometric during passive motion. In order to test the design concept clinically, 158 prostheses were implanted in 156 patients within a 9-center trial and were followed up for a mean of 17 (range 6 to 48) months. The mean age at the time of surgery was 60.5 (range 29.7 to 82.5) years. Outcome measures included the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Surgery hindfoot-ankle score and range of motion measured on lateral radiographs of the ankle. The preoperative American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Surgery score of 36.3 rose to 74.6, 78.6, 76.4, and 79.0, respectively, at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. A significant correlation between meniscal bearing movement on the tibial component (mean 3.3 mm; range 2 to 11 mm) and range of flexion at the replaced ankle (mean 26.5°; range 14° to 53°) was observed in radiograms at extreme flexions. Two (1.3%) revisions in the second and third postoperative years necessitated component removal (neither were for implant failure), and 7 (4.4%) further secondary operations were required. The results of this investigation demonstrated that non-anatomic-shaped talar and tibial components, with a fully conforming interposed meniscal bearing, can provide safety and efficacy in the short term, although a longer follow-up period is required to more thoroughly evaluate this ankle implant.||||Copyright © 2011 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

916|21816637|Metal-reinforced cement augmentation for complex talar subsidence in failed total ankle arthroplasty.|[]|The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons|There are limited options for failed total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) with major talar bone loss and component subsidence. Surgical options for this condition include revision arthroplasty, salvage arthrodesis, or amputation. Revision arthroplasty generally has been considered in situations of loose components with minimal bone loss or use of expensive custom-fabricated prosthetic components with elongated stems. Historically, failure that involves major talar bone loss has been considered resistant to reconstruction, and responsive only to complex arthrodesis or amputation. In this report, we describe a unique method of restoring talar support and preserving ankle function after failed TAA with major talar bone loss and component subsidence. Talar reconstruction using metal-reinforced bone cement augmentation is combined with the Inbone (Wright Medical Technology, Inc., Arlington, TN) total ankle system to restore talar height and ligamentous support. This technique has been used successfully in the last 4 years for various patterns of talar bone loss and obviates the need for custom components. When successfully performed, the revision technique results in restoration of mechanical alignment, anatomic height, and component support, in addition to providing substantial symptomatic relief.||||Copyright © 2011 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

This study analyses the extent to which component positioning is critical for the final range of motion.
Fourteen patients undergoing total ankle replacement were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at seven and 13 months follow-up. X-ray pictures of the ankle were taken in static double leg stance, i.e. at neutral joint position, and in maximum plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. Measurements were obtained by a specially devised computer program based on anatomical reference points digitised on the radiograms. These allowed calculation of the position and orientation of the components in the sagittal and coronal planes, together with the joint range of motion.
The mean range of motion was about 34 degrees at the first follow-up and maintained at the second. Tibial and talar components were more anterior than the mid-tibial shaft in 11 and nine patients, respectively. Mean inclination was about four degrees posterior for the tibial component and nearly one degree anterior for the talar component. A significantly larger range of motion was found in ankles both with the talar component located and inclined more anteriorly than the tibial.
Correlation, though weak, was found between motion at the replaced ankle and possible residual subluxation and inclination of the components. However, a satisfactory range of motion was also achieved in those patients where recommended locations for the components could not be reached because of the size of the original joint deformity."|||The mean range of motion was about 34 degrees at the first follow-up and maintained at the second.

Due to its advantages, the implantation of endoprostheses is constantly increasing. While finite element analyses (FEA) of strain-adaptive bone remodelling have been carried out for the hip joint in previous studies, to our knowledge there are no investigations that have considered remodelling processes of the ankle joint. In order to evaluate and optimise new generation implants of the ankle joint, as well as to gain additional knowledge regarding the biomechanics, strain-adaptive bone remodelling has been calculated separately for the tibia and the talus after providing them with an implant.
FE models of the bone-implant assembly for both the tibia and the talus have been developed. Bone characteristics such as the density distribution have been applied corresponding to CT scans. A force of 5,200 N, which corresponds to the compression force during normal walking of a person with a weight of 100 kg according to Stauffer et al., has been used in the simulation. The bone adaptation law, previously developed by our research team, has been used for the calculation of the remodelling processes.
A total bone mass loss of 2% in the tibia and 13% in the talus was calculated. The greater decline of density in the talus is due to its smaller size compared to the relatively large implant dimensions causing remodelling processes in the whole bone tissue. In the tibia, bone remodelling processes are only calculated in areas adjacent to the implant. Thus, a smaller bone mass loss than in the talus can be expected. There is a high agreement between the simulation results in the distal tibia and the literature regarding.
In this study, strain-adaptive bone remodelling processes are simulated using the FE method. The results contribute to a better understanding of the biomechanical behaviour of the ankle joint and hence are useful for the optimisation of the implant geometry in the future."|||A total bone mass loss of 2% in the tibia and 13% in the talus was calculated.

British volume|The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of post-operative symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), as well as the risk factors for and location of DVT, in 665 patients (701 ankles) who underwent primary total ankle replacement. All patients received low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. A total of 26 patients (3.9%, 26 ankles) had a symptomatic DVT, diagnosed by experienced radiologists using colour Doppler ultrasound. Most thrombi (22 patients, 84.6%) were localised distally in the operated limb. Using a logistic multiple regression model we identified obesity, a previous venous thromboembolic event and the absence of full post-operative weight-bearing as independent risk factors for developing a symptomatic DVT. The incidence of symptomatic DVT after total ankle replacement and use of low-molecular-weight heparin is comparable with that in patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement.|||||10.1302/0301-620X.93B7.26257|2011-06-28|[{'lastname': 'Barg', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Clinic of Orthopaedic Surgery, Kantonsspital Liestal, Rheinstrasse 26, Liestal CH-4410, Switzerland. alexejbarg@mail.ru'}, {'lastname': 'Henninger', 'firstname': 'H B', 'initials': 'HB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hintermann', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]

The midterm results with 10-year survival rates between 70% and 90% and the possible revision for implant exchange or arthrodesis are the reasons for the increasing importance of ankle arthroplasty. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis in particular with generally lower physical requirements can expect a pain-free function of the operated ankle for 8-10 years. In comparison to fusion ankle arthroplasty allows a significantly faster remobilization and reserves the correction capabilities of the ankle. Arthrodesis remains a valuable therapeutic alternative for severe bony destruction and instability as well as a possible fallback for failure of arthroplasty.|||||10.1007/s00393-011-0777-7|2011-06-22|[{'lastname': 'Schill', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'MVZ-Gelenkzentrum Rosenheim, Schön Klinik Harthausen, Bad Aibling.

The first 97 cases were assessed throughout the year at 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months. Data were extracted through retrospective chart review, operative reports, and electronic goniometry of the implant in maximal dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. The range of motion incrementally improved through the treatment course, with the greatest increases occurring between 6 weeks and 6 months. The mean range of motion at 6 weeks was 11.85° ± 0.824° standard error, which had increased by 3.07° ± 0.862° to 14.92° (p < .0001) at 3 months postoperatively. From 3 to 6 months, it increased 3.96° ± 0.981° to 18.88° (p < .0001) at 6 months postoperatively. From 6 to 12 months, the mean range of motion increased to 20.11° ± 1.243° (p = .3765). The overall mean increase in the range of motion from 6 weeks to 12 months was 8.25° (p < .0001). These results have demonstrated a predictable incremental increase in motion over time, with the largest percentage of improvement occurring from 6 weeks to 6 months.

It is not known, however, if this trend can be applied to other countries as well. The aim of the current study was therefore a detailed comparison of hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty utilization rates in Germany and Switzerland in the years 2005-2008 and a secondary comparison with the United States.
Based on datasets from the national statistical offices the number of inhabitants, gender and age distributions and the number of primary and revision surgeries were determined. These figures served for calculating primary, revision and overall surgical volumes, revision burden, primary and revision rates per 100,000 inhabitants, gender and age-specific primary and revision rates. A comparably smaller dataset was provided for the respective US analyses.
In Germany, Switzerland and the US the number of implanted total and partial hip arthroplasties per 100,000 inhabitants rose from 235.8, 238.2 and 116.8 in 2005 to 254.7, 262.7 and 127.3 in 2008, respectively.

With 13.6% the revision burden in Germany was 3.6% higher than in Switzerland and accounted for 11.2% in the US. In 2008 it was 15.1% in Germany, was hence 4.6% higher than in Switzerland and remained stable at 11.2% in the US. For knee replacements the 2005 German revision burden was 11.1% which was 3.5% higher than in Switzerland and was 7.4% in the US. In 2008 it was 12.8% in Germany and 4.2% lower in Switzerland and in the US it accounted for 8.9%. In all three countries the revision burden for knee arthroplasty was constantly lower than for hip arthroplasty.
In all three countries the primary rates for hip and knee replacements rose over the years but those for knee arthroplasty to a higher extent. The 2008 revision burden was highest in Germany for both types of arthroplasty. In Switzerland there was a transient revision burden decrease with a new increase from the year 2007 onwards.

Pathologically diseased ankle joints, which require surgical intervention, now have the option of a total ankle replacement system rather than the long-standing arthrodesis procedure, first described by Albert in 1878. The anatomical features and forces acting across the joint are important when designing total ankle replacement (TAR) systems. This review discusses the history and evolution of TAR prosthetic systems and considers how the ankle's normal physiology and biomechanics is incorporated into their design. The Scandinavian total ankle replacement (STAR) is a three component prosthetic system and this review concludes that its size, shape and surgical insertion technique allows the biomechanical requirements of the ankle to be met with an adequate stress distribution in particular.||||Copyright © 2011 European Foot and Ankle Society.

Total ankle replacements have been attempted since the early 1970s and design has continually evolved as the early designs were a failure. This was because the stresses involved and the mutiaxial motion of the ankle has not been understood until recently. It has been shown that the talus slides as well as rolls during the ankle arc of motion from plantarflexion to dorsiflexion. Furthermore, the articular surfaces and the calcaneofibular and tibiocalcaneal ligaments have been shown to form a four bar linkage dictating ankle motion. A new design ankle replacement has been suggested recently which allows multiaxial motion at the ankle while maintaining congruency throughout the arc of motion. The early results of this ankle replacement have been encouraging without any reported failures due to mechanical loosening.||||Copyright © 2011 European Foot and Ankle Society.

Abnormal kinematics and incongruency of the articular surface may cause increased loads applied to the implant with concomitant polyethylene wear, resulting in loosening and implant failure. The purpose of this study was to measure three-dimensional kinematics of two-component total ankle arthroplasty during non-weightbearing and weightbearing activities, and to investigate incongruency of the articular surfaces during these activities. Forty-seven patients with a mean age of 71 years were enrolled. Radiographs were taken at non-weightbearing maximal dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, and weightbearing maximal dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and neutral position. 3D-2D model-image registration was performed using the radiographs and the three-dimensional implant models, and three-dimensional joint angles were determined. The implanted ankles showed 18.1±8.6° (mean±standard deviation) of plantarflexion, 0.1±0.7° of inversion, 1.2±2.0° of internal rotation, and 0.8±0.6mm of posterior translation of the talar component in the non-weightbearing activity, and 17.8±7.5° of plantarflexion, 0.4±0.5° of inversion, 1.8±2.0° of internal rotation, and 0.7±0.5mm of posterior translation in the weightbearing activity. There were no significant differences between the non-weightbearing and weightbearing kinematics except for the plantarflexion angle.

British volume|In a systematic review, reports from national registers and clinical studies were identified and analysed with respect to revision rates after joint replacement, which were calculated as revisions per 100 observed component years. After primary hip replacement, a mean of 1.29 revisions per 100 observed component years was seen. The results after primary total knee replacement are 1.26 revisions per 100 observed component years, and 1.53 after medial unicompartmental replacement. After total ankle replacement a mean of 3.29 revisions per 100 observed component years was seen. The outcomes of total hip and knee replacement are almost identical. Revision rates of about 6% after five years and 12% after ten years are to be expected.|||||10.1302/0301-620X.93B3.25467|2011-03-02|[{'lastname': 'Labek', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'European Arthroplasty Register, Scientific Office, Innsbruck, Austria. gerold.labek@efort.org'}, {'lastname': 'Thaler', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Janda', 'firstname': 'W', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Agreiter', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Stöckl', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]

We (1) tested a novel coupled PCR-mass spectrometric (PCR-MS) assay (the Ibis T5000) on an ankle arthroplasty that was culture negative on preoperative aspiration and then (2) confirmed that the Ibis assay had in fact detected a viable multispecies biofilm by further micrographic and molecular examinations, including confocal microscopy using Live/Dead stain, bacterial FISH, and reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for bacterial mRNA. The Ibis technology detected Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the methicillin resistance gene mecA in soft tissues associated with the explanted hardware. Viable S. aureus were confirmed using RT-PCR, and viable cocci in the biofilm configuration were detected microscopically on both tissue and hardware. Species-specific bacterial FISH confirmed a polymicrobial biofilm containing S. aureus. A novel culture method recovered S. aureus and S. epidermidis (both methicillin resistant) from the tibial metal component. These observations suggest that molecular methods, particularly the new Ibis methodology, may be a useful adjunct to routine cultures in the detection of biofilm bacteria in prosthetic joint infection.||||© 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, sensory qualities, and postoperative determinants of persistent pain at 3 to 4years after total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR). Patients completed a questionnaire with included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Pain Scale, PainDetect Questionnaire, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, and questions about general health and socioeconomic status. A total of 632 TKR patients and 662 THR patients completed a questionnaire (response rate of 73%); 44% of TKR patients and 27% of THR patients reported experiencing persistent postsurgical pain of any severity, with 15% of TKR patients and 6% of THR patients reporting severe-extreme persistent pain. The persistent pain was most commonly described as aching, tender, and tiring, and only 6% of TKR patients and 1% of THR patients reported pain that was neuropathic in nature. Major depression and the number of pain problems elsewhere were found to be significant and independent postoperative determinants of persistent postsurgical pain. In conclusion, this study found that persistent postsurgical pain is common after joint replacement, although much of the pain is mild, infrequent, or an improvement on preoperative pain. The association between the number of pain problems elsewhere and the severity of persistent postsurgical pain suggests that patients with persistent postsurgical pain may have an underlying vulnerability to pain. A small percentage of patients have severe persistent pain after joint replacement, and this is associated with depression and the number of pain problems elsewhere.||||Copyright © 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Based on recent work on prosthetic and native ankle kinematics, we investigated the influence of the ankle flexion angle at the time of final component preparation on the axial alignment of the Salto Talaris TAR.
Following a power analysis based on a clinically meaningful difference of five degrees, eight fresh-frozen cadaveric thigh-to-foot specimens underwent installation of trial components using the Salto Talaris TAR system. Specimens were cycled from maximal dorsiflexion (DF) to plantarflexion (PF), as called for in the surgical technique guide, and drilling for the final component was carried out in both five degrees of DF and 15 degrees of PF using separate drill holes. These were compared with a reference drill hole previously placed along the axis of distal tibial cutting guide. Data were analyzed to determine whether components prepared in DF differed from those prepared in PF with respect to median (and variance) rotation.
We found no significant difference in median axial alignment (p = 0.139) or in variances between the two groups (p=0.937).

Also, a stepwise surgical approach for consistent correction was determined. TAR was performed on 26 patients with varus ankle deformity and a mean age of 63.85 ± 9.33 (range 48-86) years. Duration of follow-up was 16.69 ± 7.26 (range 7-37) months. The difference between the immediate postoperative frontal plane radiographic alignments was compared with the preoperative deformity, and reevaluated after at least 1 year of weight-bearing function. The preoperative mortise view varus deformity was 16.8° ± 6.79° (range 6°-28°), whereas at final follow-up the degree of varus was 0° ± 2.64° (P < .0001) on the anteroposterior view and 0.5° ± 2.7° (P < .0001) on the mortise view. All but one patient was corrected to within 4° of frontal plane neutral. Overall, correction was maintained throughout the study period.

Forty-seven subjects in four groups: three patient groups and controls, participated in the study. Each subject walked twice in 50-m trials. Plantar pressure under the pathological foot was measured using pressure insoles. Six parameters: initial contact time, terminal contact time, maximum force time, peak pressure time, maximum force and peak pressure were calculated and averaged over trials in ten regions of foot. The parameters in each region were compared between patient groups and controls and their effect size was estimated. Besides, the correlations between pressure parameters and clinical scales were calculated.
We observed based on temporal parameters that patients postpone the heel-off event, when high force in forefoot and high ankle moment happens. Also based on maximum force and peak pressure, the patients apply smoothened maximum forces on the affected foot. In ten regions, some parameters showed improvements after total ankle replacement, some showed alteration of foot function after ankle arthrodesis and some others showed still abnormality after both surgical treatments. These parameters showed also significant correlation with clinical scales in at least two regions of foot.

Currently, even though controversy still exists about the effectiveness of TAR compared to ankle fusion, TAR has shown promising mid-term results and should no longer be considered an experimental procedure. Factors related to improved TAR outcomes include: 1) better patient selection, 2) more precise knowledge and replication of ankle biomechanics, 3) the introduction of less-constrained designs with reduced bone resection and no need for cementation, and 4) greater awareness of soft-tissue balance and component alignment. When TAR is performed, a thorough knowledge of ankle anatomy, pathologic anatomy and biomechanics is needed along with a careful pre-operative plan. These are fundamental in obtaining durable and predictable outcomes. The aim of this paper is to outline these aspects through a literature review.||||||2010-11-04|[{'lastname': 'Bonasia', 'firstname': 'Davide Edoardo', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'Mauriziano Umberto I Hospital, Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Torino Medical School, Largo Turati 62, 10128, Torino, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Dettoni', 'firstname': 'Federico', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Femino', 'firstname': 'John E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Phisitkul', 'firstname': 'Phinit', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Germano', 'firstname': 'Margherita', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Amendola', 'firstname': 'Annunziato', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]
958|20964965|Clinical relevance of hindfoot alignment view in total ankle replacement.|[]|Foot & ankle international|"Alignment is instrumental for success and long-term survival of Total Ankle Replacement (TAR). At this point in TAR, only coronal alignment in the region of the tibiotalar joint or above has been assessed because inframalleolar deformity is difficult to visualize radiographically. The Hindfoot Alignment View (HAV) allows visualization of the hindfoot position relative to the tibia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of this view in assessing patients with TAR.
Twenty-eight consecutive patients with a Hintegra-TAR with an average followup of 4.1 ± 1.5 years were followed with (1) AOFAS and SF-36 scores, (2) visual judgment of the hindfoot position, (3) HAV and AP/lateral radiographs, (4) dynamic pedobarography (Novel emed m/E, Munich, Germany).
The HAV position correlated well with different load parameters on heel strike (r = 0.44 to 0.62) but not with the varus-valgus load pattern of the rest of the foot. Visual judgment and TAR joint line did not correlate to radiographic hindfoot alignment or to pedobarographic load distribution. The hindfoot alignment measured by the HAV correlated significantly to the Physical Function and Role Physical of SF-36. No correlation was found to other SF36-qualities or the AOFAS-score.
Inframalleolar alignment, as assessed by the HAV, influenced the dynamic pedobarographic load pattern and clinical outcome. Visual judgment and TAR joint line were not accurate enough to estimate the hindfoot alignment or dynamic load pattern. We believe adjusting the hindfoot correctly with HAV might improve long-term outcome and survival of TAR."|Inframalleolar alignment, as assessed by the HAV, influenced the dynamic pedobarographic load pattern and clinical outcome.

959|20801691|The use of negative pressure wound therapy for random local flaps at the ankle region.|[]|The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons|Local random flaps are seldom used for reconstruction of complex ankle wounds because of concern for flap failure attributable to vascular compromise and tissue edema. Negative pressure wound therapy has been shown to improve perfusion and limit tissue edema. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the utility of negative pressure wound therapy in improving outcomes for local flaps of the ankle. Ten consecutive patients presenting with complex ankle wounds and reconstructed using local flaps were treated with negative pressure wound therapy postoperatively. Type of flap, immediate and long-term outcomes, and complications were assessed. Seventeen local flaps were performed on 10 patients to reconstruct their ankle wounds. Mean follow up was 88 days. All flaps healed without tissue compromise or necrosis. Only one partial dehiscence and no infections were observed. This study demonstrates that negative pressure therapy may contribute to the viability of random local flaps by decreasing venous congestion. Our experience using negative pressure wound therapy on local flaps suggests that it may serve as a useful adjunct to ensure successful closure of high-risk wounds.||||Copyright © 2010 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

960|20665138|Total ankle arthroplasty in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis.|[]|Clinical orthopaedics and related research|"More than half of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) have painful arthritis, often including hindfoot osteoarthritis. Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is increasingly recommended for patients with painful ankle osteoarthritis. However, the pain relief and function experienced by patients continues to be debated particularly as compared with ankle fusion.
We asked whether (1) the complication rates were low; (2) the components were stable; (3) the patients achieved pain relief; and (4) the patients had satisfactory midterm function, ROM, and quality of life.
We retrospectively reviewed all 16 prospectively followed patients (21 implants) with HH who underwent ankle arthroplasty. They had an average age of 59.5 years at the time of surgery. We obtained a visual analog scale for pain, the SF-36, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score. Component stability was assessed using weightbearing radiographs. The minimum followup was 3.1 years (average, 5.3 years; range, 3.1-8.6 years).
Postoperatively, one patient had débridement of a painful cyst on the tibial side and one patient had a subfibular débridement with a lateral ligament reconstruction. The tibial and talar components were stable in all ankles. The average pain score decreased from 6.7 (range, 3-10) to 1.9 (range, 0-4). All eight categories of SF-36 score showed improvement. The hindfoot score increased from 46 (range, 22-67) to 84 (range, 74-94).
Our data suggest TAA in patients with ankle osteoarthritis secondary to HH is associated with a low risk of postoperative complications and produces pain relief and good function."|||Postoperatively, one patient had débridement of a painful cyst on the tibial side and one patient had a subfibular débridement with a lateral ligament reconstruction.

961|20190994|Treatment of isolated ankle osteoarthritis with arthrodesis or the total ankle replacement: a comparison of early outcomes.|['Ankle', 'Arthrodesis', 'Arthroplasty', 'Replacement']|Clinics in orthopedic surgery|"Ankle arthrodesis and replacement are two common surgical treatment options for end-stage ankle osteoarthritis. However, the relative value of these alternative procedures is not well defined. This study compared the clinical and radiographic outcomes as well as the early perioperative complications of the two procedures.
Between January 2, 1998 and May 31, 2002, 138 patients were treated with ankle fusion or replacements. Seventy one patients had isolated posttraumatic or primary ankle arthritis. However, patients with inflammatory arthritis, neuropathic arthritis, concomitant hind foot fusion, revision procedures and two component system ankle replacement were excluded. Among them, one group of 42 patients had a total ankle replacement (TAR), whereas the other group of 29 patients underwent ankle fusion. A complete follow-up could be performed on 89% (37/42) and 73% (23/29) of the TAR and ankle fusion group, respectively. The mean follow-up period was 4.2 years (range, 2.2 to 5.9 years).
The outcomes of both groups were compared using a student's t-test. Only the short form heath survery mental component summary score and Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale pain scale showed significantly better outcomes in the TAR group (p < 0.05). In the radiographic evaluation, there was no significant difference in preoperative and postoperative osteoarthritis between the TAR and fusion groups.
The clinical results of TAR are similar to those of fusion at an average follow-up of 4 years. However, the arthroplasty group showed better pain relief and more postoperative complications that required surgery."|||The outcomes of both groups were compared using a student's t-test.
